I cant help but feel like that little rabbit with the clock.|*||*|damn french keyboards.|*||*|here is the skinny folks, i am camping in a construction yard of a big kahuna for free. this man is just a ocean of generousity to us, opening doors left and right; Im living the rugged vegabond lifestyle, cooking with my mini stove, living on bread and water and hitching rides around the island. But oh my god, what an island. I will describe it later. checked out the other side of it later, there are ancient stone formations everywhere, in peoples back yards and the like. beautiful. I am taking a cargo ship to tahiti early this week, where I will give a more substantial update.|*||*|till the next ordinature.
