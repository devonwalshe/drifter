I just arrived here and I'm sitting in my mum's office and just getting my computer fix. Untill I arrived in oxford with the amazing stone work, and cobblestone street's I was seriously questioning what the hell I was doing here. In london and the surrounding towns and rural fields It's just so depressing, so dreary and despondant. But no time to tarry now, I will update more in depth a little later, Photo's too.

I also fixed the comment thing so the names will come up properly, I also added an IP logging thing, so the ip of the poster will show up, so no fooling around :)
