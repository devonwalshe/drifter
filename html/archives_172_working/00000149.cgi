This will be the last post from Edinburgh untill I return next year for the beginning of University.|*|I'm leaving on Saturday, after placing all my things at a friends house and tying up loose ends.|*||*|There is a bit too much for me to reflect on, so I'll just keep it simple and give a general post of whats going on. |*||*|I AM GOING HOME!|*||*|Fucking finally. |*||*|On saturday I'm heading down to london-town, where I will stay visiting family and friends untill Glastonbury, the undisputed heavyweight champion of music festivals. I will most likely wander dazed and confused back to london afterwards, and arrange getting myself down to Le Harve, in France. |*||*|For all the things against me, I actually managed to find a boat heading to the caribbean. It leaves on the 30th of June and I should arrive in Martinique around 10 days later. To be honest, I think all of this is hilarious. |*||*|I'm getting dumped off on this little French colonial vestige of an island, from where I will have to randomly ferry my way to the Venezuelan coast. After that I'll be traversing the americas in those charming tin funk-busses untill I get to a little port called Turbo on the Caribbean coast of Columbia. Mmmm.... I can almost hear the giant dysentry beast lurking behind me. We have a special kind of relationship me and dysentry. Old pals now. From Turbo there is a fairly regular ferry service to Capurgrana, in jungly bits of the isthmus that connects North and South America. After that details get hazy, and it looks like further transportation will most likely involve me buying jungle juice (sugar cane whisky!) for short, stunted imbred central american indians. Thats Kuna's if you want to look them up. |*||*|Brilliant. |*||*|I dont know what to look forward to more; the intense harrassment, shitting liquid fire, 3 weeks on constant motion, complete uncertainty or the fairly realistic threat of death. |*||*||*|It's going to be a giggle folks. I'll be shooting film the entire way and keeping this website updated. |*||*||*|I most likely will nae get the opportuna'e tae fire offa upda' till just before I leave. |*||*|So get-tae ----|*||*||*||*|TTFN|*||*||*|
