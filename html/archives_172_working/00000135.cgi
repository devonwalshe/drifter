I dont know where to start.|*||*|I'm screwed. |*||*|whenever the sneaky bastards at the iranian embassy choose to take my visa out from under their asses and give it to my protesting self, I will spend the next 160 our so hours on various busses across the middle east and europe.|*||*|Anyone feel like changing places?|*||*||*|My trip up to Bamiyan was... Bizarre.  Began with a rip off ride with two journalists in the front and a couple taliban (not a joke) in the back. In the middle were some amazing views, landmines, kids coming after me with guns for a "ticket", some farmer telling us he would shoot us if we continued towards an archeological site, and some dodgy kebab meat. The former put me into a feverish and hallucinogenic psychosis that kept me floored (quite literally) for a day and the toilet well used. It ended with yet another rip off ride with a breakdown in a taliban village and a quick, nervous transfer into another van.|*||*|The pictures tell the story and will be uploaded in a week and a halfs time. |*||*|The good news is.. fucking fantastic news now that I think about it... my trip is more of less over. I could kiss the filthy street outside I'm so happy. Once I get my visa I'm off, and it will be a week of daydreaming and a very sweaty ass before I get to Europe, the bosom of my happiness. Those of you who cant feel the grime under my fingernails might not understand why I'm so happy to stop travelling, but after a year and a half facing all the poverty, dirt, chaos, beggars, con-artists and drooling tour operators, I'm more then ready to go home. Or at least some place that isnt like here, and europe fits in quite nicely. |*||*|I've been told that the static life gets old quick after youve been to a few places, and I'm sure it will. But I need to feel that, to have the desire to come back before I choose to do so. Right now I cant get anything but red wine and a rare steak off my mind. |*||*|So I'm going home baby!|*||*|I couldnt be happier.|*||*|TTFN.|*|
