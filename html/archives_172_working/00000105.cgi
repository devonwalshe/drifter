Another day, another country.|*||*|I've been sitting at this computer for way to long.|*||*|My life:|*||*|I arrived last night to find out that there are no ATM machines in the entire Laos Peoples Democratic Republic. Luckily I had a small amount of Vietnamese money (called DONG for those with immature humor tastes such as me) which they changed at the border into KIP. So for the next two days I'm going to be living like an ascetic untill I can get money in my pocket. That means no internet and no updating but I will give a full account of Hanoi and my trip to Laos when I return.|*||*|So far Laos seems like a very untamed country. There dont seem to be so many people compared to the amount of land the borders give it. Driving from Vietnam I saw miles and miles of seemingly virgin jungle and beautiful limestone mountain ranges. Perhaps the beauty of Laos is not found in the culture, but the natural environment. I'm heading up to Vang Vien to wait for the banks to open and apparently this is the place to see Lao's countryside. |*||*|I'll update in full when I get back.|*||*|TTFN|*||*|
