I think it's just abfab. I don't really have much else to write as I am just filling up space to see how the text wraps around the picture, but i will delve into the cavernous depth of my miserable brain for you. Well, how about this. Let's talk a little bit about my night last night. Basically i went around to various estalishments in gastown/downtown east-side. From there i proceeded to walk up to my busstop, which was located at main and hastings. Several times i was accosted for the service of buying crack. Yet for some reason I was unfazed. It hit me later on, that these people are harmless. Typically i would expect that I would stick out and would be harrassed just for looking different. But that couldn't be farther from the truth. These people arn't dangerous, there just sick. It really opened my eyes a little bit to the situation. It may be completely lawless down there with it's own set of sub-reality rules functioning, But the results are harmless for everyone except those who are knowingly involved. |*||*|         Well this amount of text should be sufficiant for the testing of my purposes. Thanks for you all there for not reading anything i write, since nobody knows about it!|*||*||*|
