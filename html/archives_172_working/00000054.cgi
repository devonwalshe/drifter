Crazy things are happening for me at an exponential rate. It's not much of a shock, but I can tell they are having their effect on me. Being propositioned and dealing with the 10 hookers that hang around the club, flying around a poverty stricken town in the back of a rickity pickup truck through back allys, living by my own means. All this can do nothing to keep me the way I was. I can already see the change in the mirror, part of it may be aesthetic ( my tan is coming along nicely) but the other part of it is in my eyes, there is something strange there that I havn't noticed before. I can't quite explain it. For the last couple days Me and pete have been working on the boat vigorously. There is an interesting dynamic developing on board. Weve met some great people at the yacht club, lots of people from hostels looking to go through the canal. Weve made good friends with a father and son from austrailia. We were killing ourselves the other night in the bar when we found out they had both had hookers in the boat the night before. It's all about supply and demand. This country is so rich in everything except money. This place vomits life. it's coming out of every crack in the buildings and every flooded sewer hole. My spanish is actually coming along. I can get most conversations now. The place I'm at now is rediculously expensive, (comparably, a meal costs 1 USD here) so I wont dally,  I'll have a prepared post for next time. Maybe only one or two more posts before the big sail, Pictures up definetly before I go. Hasta luego
