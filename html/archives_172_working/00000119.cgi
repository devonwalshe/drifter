Greeting and Salutashuu.. uughh..ughhhns....|*||*||*||*|See what happens when I try to be cheerful? I just run out of energy half way through. |*||*|Tiny little space invaders are really screwing with my digestive tract, and the white warriors are sucking up all my resources to fight them. If you shared a bathroom with me, you'd wonder if I was on a diet of nothing but hot-sauce. |*||*||*|Life in India...  |*||*||*|After 13 hell raising hours of laying prostrate on the rancid floor tiling of an Indian train, I arrived into the circus of man-powered rickshaws, Mad Taxi drivers and beggars that is Calcutta. I was totally unmoved when my taxi driver pulled into the other lane and began weaving in and out of oncoming traffic. I've seen enough to be happy with my life, and to be perfectly honest, I really would not care if one of those Trucks came smashing into us head first, I was powerless to do anything anyway. What I could say though, was that this was definitely the most suicidal traffic I have ever seen. Vietnam is perhaps more hectic, but its all scooters. Scooters make dents, yet 20 tonne trucks will turn a taxi into a micro-machine. |*||*|The taxi made it, however and I was only jerked around twice by shifty hoteliers before I found a hotel. |*||*||*|You only ever feel like you've really arrived in a place once your checked in. Its a strange feeling.|*||*||*|I think what I'm going to do about India, regarding my updates, is update bits and pieces often, and then I'll do a big post during the end of my time here. I'm going to finish Tibet from here. |*||*|I still dont know which university I'm going to go to. |*||*|That sucks.|*||*|But I now know that I'm going to be in Paris on June 18th. That leaves me just over 1.5 months to get through India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey and the less important parts of Europe. Everything but the last part was not a joke.|*||*|So I'm going to do here what I did in Tibet. I'm going to skip all the things that I really want to see, spend a very short time here, and that way I'll be forced to come back!.|*||*|More on Tibet and Calcutta in my upcoming updates.|*||*|TTFN|*||*||*||*|
