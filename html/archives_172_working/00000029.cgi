I'd like to say hello to all my family, and I wish them all a happy christmas. I have been very busy with myself. As I've listed before I have a lot on my plate. It's wearing me down, but nothing could change my resolve that I'm doing the right thing. I hope you enjoy the new layout, if anyone is reading this or looking at my site. This will be the general look of it, I will photoshop the images, and add some intricate design elements from the east, and add a navigation bar on top, but the shape will not change. I'm getting a little burned out, but hopefully that will all change once i'm on a boat, heading across the South Pacific. Back to configuring the photo gallery!|*|
