<b>"Krabi, Thailand" ?Posted by devon on Saturday, December 13, 2003</b>
<br>
<p><br><font class="entry">
I'll let you know when I start travelling. <br /><br />I mean, I'm moving phisically from place to place, but I thought "backpacking" was so much more than that.<br /><br />It is I'm sure, a whole plethora of opportunities at your doorstep, waiting for you to happen upon them and have adventures.......<br /><br /><br />roooiiiiiigggghhhhhttt..<br /><br />my life has been slightly different.<br /><br />I felt like every time I got to port through the pacific, I had an impossible list of errands to run, which I would inevitably fail to complete, and then it was on to the middle of nowhere for 3 weeks where they didnt even have a concept of currency.<br /><br />I thought this would end with asia. But since I've got here I've had a whole host of errands to run and I now THINK they are completed but whose really to tell. Its bloody frustrating. I seem to be behaving in a completely different way then everyone I meet. But I have a premonition that its over.......<br /><br />annnny way. I have a few stories to tell. <br />The good news is that I now have some direction and know where I'm going <br />to go, the bad news is that I have to be back in Phuket in a week.<br /><br />Ahhh... root canals in paradise, There is no better way to spend your <br />holiday.<br /><br />There is something about having the most inner regions of your mouth <br />being poked, proded and molested by sharp instruments and drills while <br />the smell of burning enamel floats lazily up into your senses that is <br />just so...... so... so....<br /><br />wrong.<br /><br />Alright, I refused to get a hollow tooth fixed while I could, prolonging <br />and subsequently exacerbating the inevitable. But who wants to <br />intentionally put themselves through pain. Unless something hurts, there <br />is no immediate purpose to getting it fixed, and procrastination is <br />easy.  When it hurts, then you go get it fixed.<br /><br /><br /> ok fine I admit I have no excuse.<br /><br />I'm a failure as a human being.<br /><br />and I paid for it, financially and physically.<br /><br /><br />My time in thailand so far has been completely manic.<br /><br />After my arrival on the Sailing Yacht : Condesa that I have been with sice Darwin, I stayed in the (from what I had heard) ultra trendy beach resort of "kata beach". So in this case, and I have a feeling this is also true in other regions of thailand read "ultra trendy beach resort" as "my worst nightmare".<br /><br />But as I had "business" (another serious nightmare: bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz) to take care of, I had to be there. And i shockingly found out that I had to be BACK there in what is now a few days.<br />What did I do with my time there. <br /><br />I walked around. <br /><br />Yes thats right. I have no friends, I have no companions. I talked to no-one but the intrusive nepalese suit salesmen that jump down your throat at any opportunity. But one thing of note, actually a few things of notable noteriety happened, but I'm just going to tell you one for now.<br /><br />I had gotten used to the harrassment that follows around any young white male here. <br /><br /><br /><br />... ok hang on a second here,<br /><br />stop the train.......<br /><br />let me level with you.<br /><br />I'm exausted.<br /><br />I've travelled nearly 3000 ks over the last two days, stressed myself out beyond what I thought was possible and ate twice in a 60 hour period.<br /><br /><br />and now i"m drunk tired and I want to go to bed.<br /><br />So I'll continue this later.<br /><br />bye<br />
