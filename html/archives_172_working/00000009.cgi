Just cleaning things up around here while the programs i'm having to use for the photo gallery are being compiled. It's proved to be quite a {{link http://goatse.cx pain in the ass}} but i'm trudging along. For all you nobodies, who arn't looking at my site, i just want to assure you that yes i know it's ugly. I put together the graphics in about 5 minutes, and i plan on replacing all of them. As well as the colours. My end site will look very graphical and yummy. I don't have any great examples to show you, because i can't think of any off the top of my head, but it'll have an ancient ruines style to it. I think you'll all like it.
