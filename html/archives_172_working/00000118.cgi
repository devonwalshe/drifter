I'm cured!|*||*||*|I love India!|*||*||*|It really didnt take long. All it took was meeting a couple Indians who didnt want to sell me something.|*||*|I shouldn't jump the gun as I suppose that bad feelings could come back. But I feel completely back to normal. And in that, I really dont mind all the dirt and cow shit everywhere. In fact, its hilarious. This whole place is funny. Perhaps if the people living amongst it seemed miserable and truley unhappy with their world, It would make the scene much more depressing. But typically, everybody seems more or less content and everybody (from what I see) behaves in a friendly way to eachother and foriegners. I've had quite a few good laughs over the whole "my mother" line.|*||*||*|Really I'm serious. I love this place. |*||*||*|I suppose most of my friends know, but for those who have reached my site in another way, there is some vital information about my connection with india that must be known. My father grew up in India, and subsequently, I grew up hearing stories about this crazy place.  So ever since I could think, I've had expectations and wonderings about the place. I've also got along fabulously well with Indians over the years, and as I could find out more, and especially since I have travelled to other places in the world, I guess a lot of my questions got answered. I more or less knew what to expect when I got here, and my shock I think was more due to a general reflection on how long I'd been away from home and having to leave Kathmandu, where I had to break quite a few newly made connections. |*||*|When I think about it soberly, I'm really not at all surprised by India. In fact its exactly what I expected. Very sane, understandable people living in a very chaotic, senseless world. I really do like Indians.  Their a special bunch.|*||*||*|But I could go on rambling aimlessly on my thoughts for ages. But I just wanted everybody to know that everythings great and I'm actually really excited about the places I'll see on the home stretch.|*||*||*||*|OK ok, I wont lie to you. I am REALLY happy that I am ON the home stretch, but still, I'll be alright.|*||*||*|I have to convince my mom that I'm not going to kill myself and other email related errands, but after that I'm going to continue the ever expanding tibetan truck saga.|*||*|TTFN
