Greetings from so-called paradise.|*||*|Things have not gotten cheaper so I will keep it quick. The news is that life is nice on the boat, we get to watch movies which is a __serious__ luxury in the dirtbag backpacker circut. im just hanging out looking (half heartedly ill admit) for a boat out of here. Pete has decided to fly out which will leave me alone for the first time on my trip. Its going to be something new to say the least. Pete acts very much as a front man for our whole operation, he can lay on the southern charm at the drop of a dime. Its going to be challenging without him.|*||*|This place would be very beautiful if it wernt for the way it was governed. It just all reeks of injustice and badly deoderized colonial mold. |*||*|I had my first violent experience the other day, a large kid, with no pretext at all ( i was walking along with headphones in my ear) came up to me and got in my face. He was just some punk unwilling to take it very far but the event made me a little less trusting of the people who so far have been nothing but exceedingly kind.|*||*|To all apperances ill be here for at least another week. You will hear from me.
