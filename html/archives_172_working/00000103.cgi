I've been a flake. Trying to buy and organize 400 DVD's will do that to ya.|*||*|Periodically my updating will, yes, be less than frequent. But I'm done all the hard stuff now and I'll write as much as I can. I've seen some pretty strange things in my few days around here, from dog meat to gangsters and Cartons of cigerettes for 3 dollars. I'll do a proper update on all of it before I leave in the near future.|*||*|TTFN
