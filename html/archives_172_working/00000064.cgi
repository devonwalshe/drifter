Fresh off a cargo ship, blasting out of the shipping container that was temporarily my humble abode, I have arrived in the big city in the ocean. God its such a relief to once again be amongst dirt, perpetual noise and chaos. I was going a little bit stir crazy without all the input. |*||*|I suppose I will take the time to fill in some details. |*||*|I was feeling a little bit nervous at again putting myself back on the crew market coming in to the bay, but already this place has afforded us a few very good opportunities. Firstly, there are a plethora of boats here, and secondly, starting monday Pete ( intrepid travelling compatriate ) and I will be doing day work on a gigantic concept boat, scrubbing things for around 10 usd per hour, 8 hours a day. fantastic. Im going to need it to compensate for the rediculous... no let me elaborate... insipid, artificial, incredible, draconian, brutal, mercinary prices that they charge here.|*||*|Learning a lot about the economy here and how the french screw shit up here. Nuclear bombs and coral atolls just dont mix. But at least they have a rediculous cancer rate to show for it!!!!!|*||*|I will upload all the pictures soon ( next day or two ) to give everybody a sense of the insane journey I went through and some of the beautiful things Ive seen.|*||*|Wish me luck in the big city.|*||*||*|also, before i go, I have acuired a new partner in crime, his name is ted, you will see a lot of ted.
