I´m going to just put my location at the top from now, because I wont always explain it in the message, who needs pretentious titles anywho. Speaking of pretentious, I´m going to take that bloody face of mine off the index of the site and replace it with something else unless I get 30 000 emails telling me they like my retarded, quasi-thoughtfull look on my face plastered on the front of the site. As for the good info, I´m in colon again for the next 8 days. It sounds like a lot, but holy shit do we have a lot of work to do on the baot. only 4 or 5 major outfits, but for the most part it´s just tidying and organizing. I´m really looking forward to getting on the boat and just relaxing. It´ll be work during the crossing because it´s all shift work and you have to keep your wits about you, but once we hit the marqueses in the south pacific it´s going to be all barbeques, snorkling, music and guitar playing with the backdrop of remote tropical atolls. I´m sanguine. I´ll take pictures tommorow and get some good shots, I think it won´t be too much trouble updating from one of these internet cafe´s so I´ll do a picture update of panama sometime later in the week so you can all get a taste of it. By then the thumbnails should be working(I´m haggling even now with the cable monkeys). and I´ll fix the video section. No new shocking observations today, well none that are impersonal enough to share, so I´ll come back with some political goodness in a couple days. |*|
