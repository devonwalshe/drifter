the pictures section is busted everybody. Sorry, but there is nothing I can really do about it at this exact moment. I don't know how many of you are checking it out anyway, but for those who are, I'm doing everything I can really do right now, it's really the fault of the people who host my site, they don't have the proper programs installed for me. :(. I just upgraded it which caused the failure. some of them might work for the people who have the images cached, but no guarantees. If all else fails I can always go back to what it was, but that'll take a little work unfortunately. feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:dwalshe@plasticwrap.net">dwalshe@plasticwrap.net</a> . It get's a little bit lonely sometimes....... <em>sniffle<em>.

Thanks for the name. there are lot's of hindu's and paki's here, Maybe if i tell them my name, they will give me the HINDU RAPE  as well. I can only hope. Lot's of bad teeth here, and people who drink because their lives suck and they can't change it. I'll get the pictures going soon so you can see for youself. Tell the other Sahil and arvinder to give a shout.

I don't know if I have ever had the pleasure of that experience,  the prospect would have been just to scarry so I probably went to any lengths not to let it happen.....even when it was in my best interest!
