I worked the new job yesterday. It's quite dingy, and boring, I'll be working alone from time to time, and also not making much money. But, beggars can't be choosers. This definetely wasn't the money making venture I thought it would be though. At the very least I got to spend some time in a new country, spend some time with my mum and brother and get some good home cooking. For those who havn't seen them yet, I've added some new pictures in the england section. You can find those {{link http://drifter.ca/pictures/&album=/england& here}}.  I'm going to spend some time today working on my site, cleaning things up. I've been getting lots of regular emails from people, so thanks for that, I'll try to respond as quickly as possible. Also check back and I'll have my itinerary up. |*||*|I'm going to an anti-war rally in london on february the 15th. It's a worldwide one, so I'm suspecting that there is a rally in vancouver also. Since most people reading this are connected to me in some way or another, that would mean that most of you are prodominently anti-war. If you harbour any beliefs that things can change, please go. But if you **are** anti-war, and you don't go, don't harbour any illusions about why you didn't go. your just damn lazy :). Damn batshit crazy warmongers.|*||*|over and out
