Ok, so that **wasnÂ´t** my last post, and this one may or may not be as well, its all up in the air, I may be leaving tommorow afternoon, but it could be the morning after, things are getting done, but not at the pace we were expecting at all. Both me and pete had expected the boat to be more or less ready when we got here. such was not the case, we had to spend almost two weeks to get it ready, adn are still in the process. we expected to get here, spend a couple days provisioning, then shoot off into the pacific, but such is entropy and life. Im not sweating being on a boat for a a month, mainly for these reasons; I have ALL  my music on my ipod which plugs into the tape player that has outdoor speakers for when Im doing my shifts, I have a number of good books, namely ivanhoe, vanity fair and don quixote, I have my guitar and all my sheet music and last but not least, I have lots and lots of food. Totalled together, those are more or less the things that bring me most joy in life, while i also enjoy personal mobility, but have none of that, i think having the former few will make it alright. If I do not manage to get onto the net tommorow, all of you, keep me in your thoughts and think safe things for me, and look forward to my next update from paridise.
