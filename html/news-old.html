			<font class="entry">	yah yah yah I know, </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Still in Bangkok its shameless. I'm getting out soon.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I'm sick now. not sick sick as in sick sick, more like sick as in tired. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>To be perfectly honest I am somewhere right of the middle of a very very strange stage in my trip and my life. There are so many things going on in my head and the environment around me. I feel like I'm riding a rollercoaster for the lions share of my waking hours. The situations I've put myself in, thoughts I've been having and emotions I've struggled with have been so painful and rich, colorful and varied that I find myself half reveling in the chaos and half fighting the urge to break down.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>For example, over the last two weeks I have been battling with a serious case of low self esteem. Obviously there are a million factors that have lead to it, strange environment, lack of stability, sickness and my obvious poor communication skills to name a few. I know that some of these things are not my fault, but there are just so many things that I cant explain away as "their problem".  Mostly its the treatment I get from other people. I have high expectations with people and when people dont like me, or even just kinda like me, it destroys me on the inside. Subconcious pain. What adds the final brush stroke to the shame, dissapointment and feelings of patheticness is the fact that on the surface, I know I am acting like a complete fucking idiot. The people reading this will undoubtably think my last statement is bullshit, because most of you are either family or people who are acquainted with me. But I stress, the harsh truth is I do act like a moron. I completely replace the quality of my speech with quantity and I put myself below everybody. I'm that annoying young person who exaggerates stories and makes a general nuisance of themselves. Its staring me right in the face and I'm completely powerless to change it. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The only explanation (when I'm thinking this way) is that I just plain and simple have a shit personality. Thats hard to be confident about. Try and imagine me waving the flag, "I have a shit personality and I feel great!". That would make me even more shit.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So its made me really, really low. I've been a complete wreck actually and everthings messy.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>The bizarre thing is that I'm rediculously happy at the same time. I'm in this beautiful place, seeing intriguing things ever day, walking through night markets, having 3 year old children hawk things to me, people with bars over their shoulders and attached grills hanging down from either end, chicken cooking as they walk down the street.  The Temples, are more beautiful and mysterious than I could have possibly imagined when I left 10 months ago, even still, after so much time and places, its beautiful.<BR>And then I start my night and things go downhill. I wake up, feel the shame, and good things happen. Its up and down, up and down. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Beautiful and sick, </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Hard and easy,</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Love and Hate.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Every day. Its not in any capacity wearing me down. sometimes I feel as though I could stop a train with my will, and others that a feather would fell me in an insant. So the end result is that I am somewhere in the middle, with painfull extremes. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Ok enough of that.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I guess the over arching purpose of even mentioning intensly personal things could be </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>A. I'm pathetic, attention seeking and crying for help</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>or </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>B. I'm trying to bring the audience in and make them understand where I am coming from.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>rationalization would prefer B.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I could tell you soooo many stories about these places. Maybe I should start doing that, because I have met  many travel writers who are just plain bad at writing, yet the subject material here is so easy to write about that they pass as good. Everything that happens here would be readible, regardless of the quality of writing. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So I'll try once I catch up from Fiji. I promise, I'll stop all this trying to distance myself from critisism by sabotaging my work thing. I will compose, </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I will give you colors, places, people things.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I promise.</font></td></tr>

			<font class="entry">	I've been here for almost a week now, and I still havn't gotten sick of it like most people do after one day. I was talking to another metrophyte in my guesthouse adn he described the feeling very appropriately. He said the smog seeps into your pours and gives you a fix like a junkie. Bangkok has no shortage of smog (or mask wearing residents) and I'm sucking it up by the lungfull....</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I went to the biggest market in Bangkok yesterday, the Chatachuk weekend market and paid my homage to the capitalist gods by splurging on cloths and other things. I got 3 well made skate t's, one cotton open neck shirt, one button up and one thai style loose fitting open neck thing all for under 20 US dollars. I felt so much better coming home on the bus and it must have made a difference because I made like 3 friends last night and went out all over town. I was thinking on the way back how wrong and pathetic it was to have material goods fill the void in self worth that I have been experiencing and it made me think about the perils of capitalism. About all the lonely people all over the world with money who fufill their spiritual voids with material consumption. But was I wrong to feel good? I think recognition of the problem is the only thing that is required of us. Recognizing that the void is there in the first place, and maybe, one day, as a culture we can figure out some way of being happy independantly. So after pacifiying my doubts with the said intellectual opiate, I let my self slide into the  euforia of consumption.  Ahhh....... </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I'm crossing my fingers they dont start hating me soon, and I'll actually have someone to travel with for a little while. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Fahad said it well, (friend I met in KL and again here on my first day, now he's in quatar, good guy, very nice to me.)</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>"man, you have some serious self esteem issues"</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I laugh about it, but its true. I dont take it too seriously, kind of like my own little personal joke. But I'm kinda feeling pretty worthless as a human being lately. It has nothing to do with "the harshness of my environment" or "culture shock", I feel perfectly at home here. Its more to do with my failure at communicating my personality. Its right frustrating. I'm all sorted out in my head, I think well of people, I want to help, I'm usually pretty happy and quite confident. And then I open my mouth and everything comes out backwards and wrong. I'm constantly at an ends with people, either because the truth is I'm just a complete asshole (i'm hoping this isnt true) or people just dont understand where I'm coming from. Whenever I try to say something I mean, something I've spent a while thinking up, people usually interperate as something hostile, prejuidice and ignorant. The product of closemindedness and hasty thought. So I get cut down all the time. Not that I cant handle myself in an argument, as anybody whose been within 10 feet of me would know,  but I would rather people understood the sense in what I was saying, because there usually is some. And I'm not expecting that of people, because I talk to people all the time, and the result is -usually- the same. So obviously the common denominator is me. Its my failure. And I hate it. I'm starting to make up for the poor quality of what I say with quantity. Just blabbing on and on at 3000 words a minute. Sometimes I surprise myself with how fast I can talk. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So like I said, I'm in a pretty bad state. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I dont want to pull a holden caufield or anyone. I'm not permanently disssolutioned or anything. I just need some good ol fashioned social contact. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>My emails down right now, going to be down for I dont know how long. I'll set up a temporary one and post it here so the people who need to get a hold of me can.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So I havn't really described any of the places that I've been talking about. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Rarotonga in the Cook Islands, is the capital Island. Its only got 18 000 people on it, which is something rediculous like 80 % of the population. It reminded me exactly of French Polynesia. The people are connected by race and culture. Polynesians through and through. The mountains are high and rugged all over the island, blanketed with thick thick green foiliage. All the settlements are always along the fringe of the Island. Rarotonga in particular has perfect white sand that goes around pretty much the entire Island and has an international airport that takes up a large chunk of the Island. The people are so friendly that you never get used to it. They continue to astonish you every day. As you walk by the road there might be a  small market in a parkinglot, with large Polynesian Mamas wearing Old mother hubbards (floral patterned, brightly colored cloth potato sacks) beaming at you as you go by. There are usually a few Policemen on the Islands, who know everybody and can be found sitting with a group of men having a laugh on the side of the street or a bench somewhere. Fish is the food, because the topography of the islands make almost any type of industry or agriculture impossible, meaning people are poor and dont have a lot of money to spend on different foods when they can just as easily build a boat and ensure good quality eating. They have jobs though. Building things, working in banks, restaurants, the movie theater or government administration. Its small scale, but there is an economy. On many of the pacific islands tourism is the big money puller, so of course, may people are tour operators or work in hotels etc.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Time goes very slowly on the islands, if it moves at all. "Island time" is a common response to the question "what time is it?". The environment makes up for the peoples relitive poverty. In many cases they can get a few building materials to build a sturdy house with a zinc roof, or better, They can eat enough, because there is always enough fish around, and they dont have to worry about heating, being in the tropics. The one problem in this apparent ideal lifestyle is the cyclones. When they come throguh everythign gets destroyed, people die, our countries give them money, they rebuild and wait for the next one and the process to repeat. Another problem is they have tv and westernization, and with it, they want stuff. So then they start thinking they need to fix their economy, things change, usually meaning introducing advanced methods to the government and things get complicated. But thats just the way it goes, and you cant ever ask people to go backwards, even if it was more stable. So now they are thrust into the so called world economy and when you add small remote pacific islands with the company of the international business community, wacky things start to happen. The cook Islands for example, opened itself up as a tax haven for all manner of questionable enterprises for years and years untill the new zealand government (who supports a large part of the cooks economy) put a stop to it.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Or Niue, where the internet is free because An internet porn Czar cut a deal with the government of that nation. The deal was, they let him traffic in websites that were completly illegal to have anywhere else, and he had to provide free internet for the countries entire population, a grand total of 1200 souls when I was last there and falling.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In Vanuatu they are trying to take the economy very seriously, you hear preacher style rallies everywhere and they signed the GATT and entered into the WTO. A little bit of a symbolic act I think as their entire gross domestic product is something like 20 million dollars per year. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So you get a feeling for the seeds of change when you visit these islands. Some people on them want very much to be part of the international community, but its difficult for them considering they have no money and are extremely geographically remote. Life on them, I would argue is still quite nice. Most people live a happy existance, they have Jesus Christ, which was a painful introduction, but now that the damage is done, he keeps them happy. They eat when they want (too much in a lot of cases), they work when they want, and they play when they want. They are not productive, I never saw anybody working for more than 2 hours at a time. They are close to their families and have some sort of an equilibrium worked out. In many places there are problems that need to be fixed, things that need to get done and change seen, but these are no different than the problems that go on anywhere else, even in the most affluent or "stable" places. Like child abuse, spousal abuse, alcoholism or saftey hazards. Certain things are worse in some places and others in others. People are trying to change it and I dont see it as an earth shattering issue.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Lifes alright, not without its issues but it goes on. They always have their kindness to fall back on.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So what I've described  above goes for almost all of the islands unless I say different. Circular, rugged mountainous interior and settlements all along the outside and friendly, subsistance surviving people. The cities are cities. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So I was on Fu T'ien on my way to Fiji?</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>My pictures are almost done uploading and i have buddha's to see so I'm not going to go into it, I feel like I've done enough for today. I hope you agree.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>Have a good one.</font></td></tr>

			<font class="entry">	I've been sitting down in this goddamn internet cafe so long my fingers are going numb, making it difficult to type. The last time I remember this feeling was in Vancouver, working on my site in the early hours of the morning when my dad refused to keep the heating on. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I'm in a bad state.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>Wont go into attention deprived whining.... so I'll just shut my mouth and get on with my task.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I had about 1000 words of an update finished yesterday when the miserable excuse for a computer I was working on spontaneously combusted, sending me flying across the room.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Not really, it just crashed. But the result was the same, without the third degree burns; I lost the update. It was mucho frustrato.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I'm uploading pictures now so those of you with a connection fast enough can check them out. I'm beggining to think that is nobody these days. My site is going excrutiatingly slow, despite my continued whippings and shouts. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Oh boy, just checked the speed... I'm going to be here for a while, popsicle style. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I decided in my last lost post that I had gotten reduclously off track. I was halfway through my malaysian jungle story yet was still in tonga with the catch up. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I know nobody wants to hear about what happend to me 4 months ago. But you know what </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>I DONT CARE!!!!!!!!!!!</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>there we go, that was satisfying. alienating the reader, its every writers wet dream.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>SCREW YOU YOU BASTARDS I'M GOING TO WRITE WHAT I WANT AND YOUR GOING TO LIKE IT WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>ok. That wasn't me talking to you, that was the picture of an embittered and jaded writer, in truth, I like you guys, but I feel like a little bit of a whore to my own urge to communicate. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So where were we. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I think I was somewhere in Neafu, getting drunk. Yess that was it. The boat I was on had recently kicked me off, because he was staying there for a while, yet I was trying to move along to the next country, Fiji. I almost got on a boat one of the first nights I was there but was the unfortunate recipient of a trashtalking affair, and another reason for the owner not to take me was his 19 year old daughter was just a little to upset at his decision not to take me on. Hey fair enough, I mean, I wouldnt trust me with a 19 year old girl either. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So after a few more nights of getting poisoned with the monkey crew they all took off to another anchorage for a beach party, commemorating somebody or others departure (a very weak excuse to get drunk and party on a deserted tropical beach) and I stayed in the capital and looked for a new boat. A single handed Catamran sailor from Germany (you would have thought I had learned my lesson about single handed catamaran sailors wouldn't you?????) offered to take me in to his boat to stay while I looked for another boat that was leaving sooner. The idea was I would work a couple hours a day for my room and board. It was actually a lot of fun. Manfried, the owner had this bizarre sense of humor that made you laugh in mix of laughing at him and at the joke. After a few days a junk rigged boat rolled in (a little uncoordinatedly I must admit) and pulled up a mooring ball. I had had heard through the yachtie grapevine before stating they needed crew and made no delay in buzzing over on manfrieds dinghy and offering myself up as fresh meet for the grinder. The very politely invited me aboard and just as I walked up over the scuppers the wife popped out of the cabin with a steaming loaf of fresh bread. She saw my jaws drop and smiled. It was a family of four; the husband, a pome (british person) named jeremy, The wife, a german lady named Almuth and the two young children, Klaus at 6 and Eva at 4 and they all lived in New Zealand. After we had smoothed out the details (yahooo baby I was going to fiji!!!!!!!!!!!!) Almuth, the typical German matriarch says to me in a mocking stern way, "alright! you catch us a fish and I'll bake you some bread!". Got german people intimidate me sometimes. I avoided giving any form of substance to my answer as I had no idea what kind of tackle they had and more importantly,  guaranteeing a catch is the most definite way to insure the opposite.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I was happy though and spent the next two days with manfried on "paseo" before moving my bags over to the Junk rig, named "Fu T'ien"</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In that period the monkies came back and I recieved my permanent monkey name. A few names had kicked around for me but in the end, it was "clairsmonkey" that stuck. The reason does not exactly fill me with pride. Clair was the name of the daughter of that captain that had refused to take me and apparently, from what I heard, she lost it a little bit at the bbq concerning the decision. I"m pretty sure it had more to do with her fathers domineerance than anything else, but the monkies thought it would be hilarious to construe it as abject dispair over misssing my company over the next two months to australia. Jerks. I mean, the fondness had nothing to do with me. I swear. So my name stuck to the embarrasment of me and clair. When they came back, it was right back to the old shinanigans. Drinking any time two or more of us were together, getting in out high powered dinghies and harrasing combattants in theweekly yacht race, making a nuisance of ourselves anyway we could  etc etc..<BR>When I moved on to fu t'ien, they planned to move out to another anchorage for a few days untill the weather window cleared up for us to start the passage to fiji. In that time I got to know the kids, GREAT kids they were. I love kids, cant wait to buy a pair of my own. They accesorize with anything!!.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>But yah, I taught Klaus, the little guy to dive the keel of his boat. I really couldnt believe it myself considering it took me way longer to do it then it did for him. Admittedly, it was hard work, but there is no way I could have done it if he wasnt an extrodinarily brave child. which he was.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>My method was to dive down a little ways, and get him to come down and give me a high five. I would get progressivly deeper and get him to go deeper and deeper. Then I told him he was ready for the keel and after a few tries, he did it. It was inspiring. Really didnt hurt me as far as the parents were concerned either.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The boat was a mess. It was completly excusable however because it was a family of young children, at an age when drawing on anything with a crayon was the norm. And thats what most of the boat looked like, a childrens playroom. In a way that was a good thing. It meant the parents were willing to make concessions for thier children, as taking kids cruising is an undeniably selfish act. Viciously cruel in some cases. The kids seemed pretty well adjusted, but I felt incredibly remorsful when I saw them in the misery of thowing up while we were on passage. My bunk was pretty comfortable anyway, and the best part of it was I could charge up my ipod and tune out any time I wanted. Something Almuth would comment on near the end of the passage in a way that I couldnt fully understand.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Jesus, I can't believe I remember every intimate, stinking detail about the things I did 4 months ago. Pretty cool, preeetttyy cool. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So rediculously, The adventure monkies, (the three guys on the stinkpot with an unholy sized dinghy) who were in a anchorage further still to nieafu to the one I was, would pick me up with other people specifically so we could all drink together at the bar. It was sweet. Using the VHF is so much fun. I miss it. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>"ksshhttt, ...adventure, adventure, this is fu tien do you copy over, ...kkksshht",</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>"kshhttt, ...yah this is adventure here lets go six six over ...kssht"</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>"kshhtt... going six six over.... ksshhhtt" </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>And then once you switched channels the conversation would continue more or less like a telephone one, with a few fun differences. I wont try to describe the feeling, but its just one of general badassness.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So they would pick us up and we would fly at 25 knots over the mirror smooth water on a full plane, at night. The person on headlight duty at the front of the dingy could poing the light downwards and illuminate all the phosphorescance, giving us the feeling that we were flying with the stars above and stars below. As the water was crystal clear, the little creatures that were lighting up could be seen deep down, giving the water a truly volumetric appearance. It was so beautiful that it moved us all to silence. Wrecklessly dangerous too, but what young fun would be fun at all without wrecklessness.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Those last nights at the bar were more fun than any other times we spent together. We all knew the fellowship was breaking up soon and made a point to have fun. I at least was glad to know that I was moving on in a reletively simmilar time to most people, so I would without doubt have the option of meeting up with some of them. As it turned out, The next meeting of the monkies was going to be more epic than the first. On the last night, a wednesday night which also happend to be the busyest of nights at the mermaid we had a big party which I remember only portions of. Most of the pictures I have from tonga are from that night. There were so many yachties there, I'm sure I saw a lot of good people that I met along the way for the last time that night at the mermaid. boo hoo life goes on I know but you can't feel the fond memories I can about it, the nostalgia. That wispy, undefiend feeling of pain joy and sorrow mixed all together. Its intensified when I think about the week I spent with them in Musket Cove. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I was set to spend the night on another junk rigged boat that would be moored in the bay of refuge (neiafu harbour) that night. Another nice family from BC, with two eligable daughters that proved completley and utterly unattainable due to there close and personal friendship with our lord and saviour Jesus Christ. I can't think of one more name more loaded than Jesus Christ. Maybe "elvis presly" or something, but that just doesnt have the same stopping power. Could you imagine if you met somebody, asked them their name and they responded calmly and orderly, "yah, Its Jesus Christ, but my friends call me JC". You'd think they were fucking crazy!</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>ok anyway, back to the story. I get a little off track with my story telling sometimes, I'm even doing it in person. I just can't help myself. I guess i have to learn.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>ROOOIIIIGHHHHHHT..</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I mean nobodys really reading at this point anyway. You dont fool me. I could be talking about doing horrid things to your mothers and you wouldnt know the difference.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>but I'll get back to it because one day I'LLLLLLLL enjoy reading it, even if you dont.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Sobering up at 4 am, one of the monkies passed out in the dingy, I  at length convinced the adventure boys to give me a ride to anchorage number 5, where I was staying. The anchorages there are numbered after whats written in the Moorings (big ass yacht charter company) cruising guide for the company. Its so out of hand that some of the locals will tell you they live at anchorage 16. Things strange and bizzare all aroudn the world i tells yah. They gave me a ride and the next morning we weighed anchor and set off with the morning sun beating down on our backs. A group of nice little spinner dolphins escorted us out, giving us the telltale sign that our passage would safely, which it did, but not without its own little problems.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I watched my buddy gavin blow by us on the boat he worked on. 77 feet and just screamed past us in the light air. the beggining of the bad that was. I asked the Jeremey what a typical crusising speed was for them and he chuckled, "oh we wont get this girl up above 4 knots."</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Oh god... I nodded and went down below to process that.  I didn't really care at the time, but the worst was yet to come.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>My pictures are just about finished so I'll leave it there. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>It was a rough passage, nothing of the 42 day passage from hell, but It had its up and downs so to speak.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>till next time.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR></font></td></tr>

			<font class="entry">	I'm fighting off a creative hangover. Its finding new and perverse ways to torture me and make me collide with stationary objects.

I feel like a gorgon when I go down to the beach, there is no way that this many naked women with immaculate figures should exist in such concentration and proximity.

			<font class="entry">	I dont know where to start.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I suppose where I left would be the -obvious- answer.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>God I'm thick.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Last update I was in Kuala Lumpur, awating christmas so i could make phonecalls back home and to friends. I actually MET people there which was nice and saw a bit of the city. Adventures there include pretending I was a journalist on a few occasions to get access to things normal people couldnt, mainly to take photographs and getting led into a dank concrete hovel where a bunch of coke-head triad teenagers were peddling pirated dvds, which a bunch of travellers I was with bought. KL was a beautiful city, I enjoyed my time there. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I left KL on the evening of the 26th. I had met a traveller from New York, who had Pakistani liniage, and we had resolved to meet up here for new years. I decided to spend the time in the middle in Malaysias largest national park, Taman Nagara, a 150 million year old virgin jungle. I travelled non-stop from KL to the park, ending up in rediculously small towns with no-where to go, getting rides from strange people who didnt speak english and seeing bizarre, run of the mill travel stuff. Like driving across rural roads, and seeing trash being thrown arbitrarily on the side of the road, or having to avoid cows and goats. The list goes on and on. Being on a bus, getting thrown up into the air because of the potholes, surrounded by colorful shawls and smoking males. Its pieces of magic all day long.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I finally got to the jumping off point to the park, Jerantut, late at night and there was no way I was getting to the park that day. I spent a night there and in the morning missed the early bus because I was trying to find an atm in the town, which was no easy task. So i waited amongst the ancient looking, turbaned, toothless and bent old men, shawled women and playful kids for a few hours before catching a bus to Kuala Tembeling, where I caught a river ferry to the park. By the time I got there I was 5 O'clock in the afternoon. The river ferry took 3 hours and crawled upstream through the dense jungle. Along the banks we passed a huge monitor lizard and every kind of bird you could imagine. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I cooked up a scheme that I would maximize my time in the jungle if I left *that night*. I thought it would be easy. I had seen tours advertized sending people off at night for walks, and figured "hey, I can do that by myself, no problem". </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Idiot.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>When I got there I met up with a couple from the hostel I was staying at in KL and got some information about the trails from them, and how to get a permit from the park ranger. My plan was I would walk out to a "hide" ( raised platform outside with wooden bedframes inside) 3km from the main camp that night. Then the next morning, take a trail 15 Ks up to another hide, way out in the middle of nowhere, and then come down another trail the next day back to camp, where I would take a 3 pm bus to the border and cross into thailand to get here on time for new years.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The plan was absolute magic on paper. Going outside of where most people went, maximizing the chance I would see some kind of animal. It was great. I was looking forward to using my stove. I bought my provisions, packed my day bag and put my big pack away for safe keeping. I took a ferry boat across the river, and went up into the rangers office to get my permit to stay in the hides, which each carried a 5 ringit fee for spending the nights in them. After I told him my plan, he looked at me soberly and frowned. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>"you go tonight?". </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>yup.... </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>"you go alone". </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>yup.... </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>"oh no sir, you cant do that. We do not recommend treking at night, anything can happen"</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I pondering what he meant by "anything can happen" as I casually looked around his office to see the pictures of tigers, leopards and bears photographed in the park. OK so the seed of doubt was planted in my head, and stubbornly, I went on with my plan. I told the ranger I had a flashlight and would be fine. I've done this kind of thing before. But nothing i could say would wipe the frown off his face and he never actually accepted what I was planning to do, but he sold me permit anyway. It was late dusk as I stared into the trail, having to ask for directions a couple time on my way in. Every one of them could barely believe what I was doing. I mostly wrote it off because I get that kind of reaction every day on the road. People can never fully believe that I'm travelling alone, and so young. When I tell them that I've been gone for 9 months and I'm travelling over land for the next nine to Europe, their faces usually go blank and I get the kind of treatment you would expect if you were telling someone an obvious lie. Its just outside their realm of reality. Its too much for them to handle. Not travellers though, they all believe me and are generally supportive. So when people looked at me like I was crazy and told me I wasn't leaving tonight, I was going to leave in the morning, I just smiled and kept walking. Once I got on the trail. The seed of doubt that had been planted by the pictures of mortally dangerous animals on the wall was fed and watered by the sounds and the darkness of the jungle. Apprehension set in. It was quite nice to be walking along at a brisk pace though. That beginning of a hike feeling of vigor and health coursing through your viens, preparing you for the adversity up ahead. But nothing like this could prepare me for what I was coming up against in the next few hours. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Nothing.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>After the sun fully set, the que was made for every one of the bandmembers of the sickening, screeching death symphony to start playing there horrifying, demonic music. My ignorance and stupidity, my complete lack of respect for natural dangers that has carried me thus far across the ocean and through the outback acted as a slight barrier to the fear that was trying to penetrate into my heart. I just took deep breaths and blew on the Kiwi dog whistle which was made for me by Bree's stepfather of sorts in Australia. The idea I had was, that I would blow on the whistle as I walked to alert any large animal to my presence and therefore keep it as far away as possible. It was evident once I actually got in however, that my whistle, while loud enough to split the ears of any normal human being, was no match for the symphony of the jungle. As I walked, unique noises, seperate from the driving, deafening cricket like noises that provided the walls in a room of sound would erupt right next to my head, evoking in my imagination the picture of a decaying banshee working through some horribly inner termoil right beside me. Or the hissing that was a spitting hydra. the low, morbid whooping: a lonely harpee. All of these creatures manifested themselves in the jungle that I could only hear, but not see. I tried depserately to invoke some sort of fear in them, maybe that that monsterous whistling beast might eat them. But no, They played on, despite my blows.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> The path was by no means even. I was climbing up root systems of huge invisible banyan trees and ducking under creepers and climbing over fallen logs. To make matters worse, my flashlight made only slight inroads throught the dense blackness that surrounded me like a fog that you could only cut through. I could see either the ground three feet ahead of me, or the wall of jungle 6 feet in front. I alternated between the two, ignoring the panic stab that struck every time the shadows of a small plant cast by my flashlight would suddenly dart towards me as I walked by them. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I walked on. Determined to get to the hide that night. It was only pain, and pain is always temporary. I would be fine as soon as I got there. Those words lost there meaning momentarily after they were thought, not nearly powerful enough to compete with the fact that I was alone, in the dark, in the jungle, where no small number of men have lost their lives. Two hours in I had not seen a sign. In fact, I realized that I didnt even know the name of where I was going. All I had was vaugue directions of "go past the bridge, ten minutes after the jetty on the river. Obviously this was said assuming I could SEE  the jetty as I went past it. I had seen nothing. I started asking myself if I was lost. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Am I lost? Did I miss a turn off? Why the hell am I putting one foot in front of other if I'm lost? If i am lost, what the hell am I going to do? Why does that whooping noise sound so human? Why are you so stupid? this is your fault you know. Idiot.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Then I started running through the necessary chain of communication for my parents to find out that I was dead or missing. I had informed virtually noone of my plans OR whereabouts, I would not be missed for days and days and days. People back home could easily write off my lack of communique as regular busyness. It might be two weeks before questions were even asked. Maybe a month before the Park could contacted, and another week for any kind of search party to be called out. By that time everything I considered to be "me" would be fully digested and excreted through the stomachs of  the thousands of different species of bugs, mammals and reptiles that live in the park. Like I said, complete lack of respect for natural dangers. Thats me. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I prayed my flashlight wouldnt give out. I kicked the bushes to make extra noise. I tried my best to keep hysteria and dispair at bay. Took deep breaths and tried to quicken my pace, in the hopes that I was going the right way. I crosed a suspension bridge which swang 4 feet on either side of me with each step I took. I couldnt even see what was below me.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>Finally, Finally I reached a signpost. It said I had about another 45 minutes to go, but at least I was on the right trail. I was still shit scared walking through the jungle, but at least I had something to hang on to. I saw hides at every turn, untill I at length arrived at the real one. Trembling from the exersize and my nerves, I walked up the steps and found the doorway blocked. Noises inside and a Japanese boy opened the door. He spoke a little english and I took my long deserved sitdown. I started making myself peanut butter bread spreads and sharing them with the japanese kid. There was noone else in the hide.<BR>He took out a package of crackers I think to be polite, even though I didnt take any. Put my bread up in a little hideaway and left a few of my soup packages and my closed jar of peanut butter out and made my bedding up on one of the wooden frames.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>That night included its own minor adventure and although I was safe for the moment and monumentally relieved, I was by no means out of the frying pan. I had another two days following that in the jungle and had no idea what to expect.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I've written enough in one sitting, I have no idea how I'm going to get it all out... But I'll continue this when I can either today or tommorow, its relaxation time for me here in ko pha ngan. I'm not going anywhere.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Pictures are updated, all the ones from malaysia and the national park, including my last night in the country (spent in a parkinglot playing music with a bunch of young guys and getting patchy sleep on the ground there) and KL.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>till next time.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR></font></td></tr>

			<font class="entry">	Being in this city feels like I'm at home. Except home would mean that I live in a house, could cook my own food. I would have permanent friends and hell, if things were going well I would be sleeping with a girlfriend every night rather than around 200 bedbugs. Its a nice city though, and I am a city boy at heart, so I'm comfortable here. I've been extremely unproductive and havn't seen any of the sights. I'll see some tommorow, Christmas eve, then leave Christmas evening after making phonecalls back home. The tallest building in the world is housed within KLs golden triangle district; The Petronas Towers. The scam is that the viewing platform is only halfway up the bloody towers. Crooks.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Ok Ok OK .... So where were we. I think I left off in Tonga after my little cave expidition? I told a little lie at the end of my last update. There was something else to report that occured before we headed back to Neiafu and "The Mermaid". </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Apart from the cave I told you about, Swallows cave, there is a much more famous one in the Vava'u group called Mariners cave. The novelty of Mariners cave is that it is also an aquatic cave, but it can only be reached by taking a deep breath, diving around 10 feet under the water and swimming through an underwater hole leading through the limestone wall and into the cave. I've read a lot of stories about how people took a lifetime to overcome their fears about getting in to the cave, and I was a little bit apprehensive. But the fact is that I'm young and stupid and people like me tend to think they are invincible, so I really didnt think about it too much.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>We had to get GPS coordinates to the cave because it was kind of in the middle of a 3 mile long sheer limestone wall. When we sailed up and saw the tell tale signs, Andrew, the captain stayed on the boat while me and the other crew jumped off the boat and swam up to the hole. I watched the fuzzy blue circle materialize out of the deep blue of the sea as I swam closer. Mike, the other crew, dove  first and I watched him gracefully turn upside down as he swam downwards for around 10 feet before straigtening around and flipping upside down, watching the roof of the entrance as it gave way to the inner chamber of the cave. Not brave enough to be so daring, and not nearly confident enough with my lung capacity. I just dove down and nearly broke my neck looking over my shoulder to make sure that I didnt hit the roof of the entrance tunnel. I surfaced inside and the cave was much smaller than swallows, and less interesting to look at. But the novelty was in another phenomenon. Between the swell that would make the water level inside the cave rise and fall, and the fact that there was no opening to the outside, the air would depressurize when the swell brought the water down,  a light PFFFFFFT sound would echo through the cave and the water in the air would condensate into an eirie fog that floated for 3 feet above the water. Then, quickly and strangely as the fog materialized, the water level would rize, re-pressurizing the air and the fog would simply fade away, making the water and the stone near the surface look crystal clear. It happend over and over, along with the echoing sounds of the swell banging up against the walls. It made your ears pop and the air harder to breath when the fog was around. It also felt a little bit like a sauna. When the swell came in strongly the fog would fill the entire cave thickly and you couldnt see 2 feet ahead of you, for it to simply dissapear in a fraction of a second. It felt like being on another planet, with another set of rules for nature. It didnt take long to soak in the atmosphere, so after about 15 minutes inside the cave, we swam out and let Andrew have a go while I sailed the boat in circles just off the cliff wall. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So it was some time after that that we returned to the mermaid.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>That  night was the first night in nearly 6 months that I spent simply in the company of a bunch of people near my age, sitting at a table at a bar, going through the motions. It was so relieving. We all told our crazy boat stories and I approached the Father of a family boat from south africa whom I had heard needed crew. His daughter was my age and her little brother was 16.  The bar was absolutely packed with yachties and I had a really good night catching up with people I hadnt seen for ages. yachties really like to drink. They dont have jobs, wives, husbands or responsibilities to crawl back to, sheep faced and hungover in the morning. So they just let it all hang out. Not a bad way to live i'm told. I got myself overexcited and ended up behaving a little coarsley with my new acquantinces, and stupid stupid stupidly I opened the channels of communication with the daughter on the boat I was trying to get on. Big mistake it turns out. Over the next week we were absolutly rabid with the celebration of being in proximity with non grey haired people. We solicited the services of that seductive mermaid like there was no tommorow. Half way through the week, I realized as 4 of us went off to Eros, one of our boats, a 55 foot teak decked full keeler  in the "BIG TENDER" (Dinghy on stereroids) of Selini, and 80 foot swan to go look at the ryans cabin that we were absolute brats who lived a life far above what was deserved. We were all just like every other bachelor degree aged animal. I've met tons and there was no difference between us and anybody else. But for some reason we were in TONGA, boozing it up for pennies at a waterfront bar, tanned and drunk driving in multi thousand dollard DINGHYS. It was just so irresponsible and so much fun in the process. I couldnt help but feel a little sheepish. Like something wasnt right, even though it felt so much so.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Out of this period, The <a href="http://drifter.ca/pictures/?album=%2FTonga%2FMonkey%20Business%20night&image=monkies.jpg&">Monkey Crew</a> was born. It started off as a very very innebriated conversation, and evolved into giving ourselves monkey names. For instance, Ryan was called Woah-monkey because he looks like Joey laurence, an early nineties sitcom teen dream. Gavin was called swab-monkey, because thats what he was, a swab.  Sam was called splash monkey, because he drunkenly fell into the water trying to get into his dinghy one night. The rules were that any monkey name had to have monkey on it, and had to be slightly insulting to the person that it was bestowed upon. And under no circumstances could a monkey name themselves. My name takes a little bit of explaining. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So splash monkey I met for the first time in Tahiti.  He was taking on his first job as a captain of a yacht owned by a guernsey couple. Guernsey is a haven for ultra rich english people off the coast of france, used as a tax evasion location. It was on the Papetee dock at a party for a crew member of a big big yacht. At the time I was doing day work on a 111 foot concept boat, so me and pete, the arizonan guy I crossed the ocean with felt comfortable crashing their little party. Splash monkey is from White rock, Vancouver, and we had a lengthy argument about the pros and cons of the High Five. Him fighting against, and me fighting for. It was an inane argument carried out for an absurd amount of time, and by the end of it. He apparently developed a strong strong dislike for me. Because the next time I saw him, that first night at the mermaid in tonga, He immediately went up to the captain I had approached and gave his full "professional oppinion" about my worthiness as a crew member. I found out the next night from Clair, the daughter of the captain who felt a little vindictive against sam.....</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>ok my hours wearing out... </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I'll continue this gripping thread tommorow.. or the next day, or the next... we'll see.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Merry christmas bah humbug.<BR></font></td></tr>
