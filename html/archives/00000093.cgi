I would like to start by explaining the status of the site over the last two weeks.|*||*|My last post was from Bangkok and it was there that my site kind of broke and it was also from there that I began the migration of my site from one location to another. Its no simple task and it has taken these two weeks to complete the move.|*||*|Those of you who were worrying about me following the last post that was put up, thank you. I wont go into it now, but almost immediately after that day, I spontaniously regained my confidence and have been a completely different person since. I'm convinced that stage happened for a reason and I almost feel like I've entered the "golden age" of my trip.|*||*|I left bangkok to make my way through the old northern capitals of Thailand while I was waiting for my Chinese and Indian visas to be processed in Bangkok. I had an amazing time and will describe it all when I get to it. After a day in Bangkok, I got my visas and set off the next morning to Cambodia. Crossing the border I was smacked in the face by its contrast to Thailand. I was NOT expecting it to be so different. I will also explain this later. I spent a few days in Pnomn Penh and I'm now in Siem Reap, the jumping off point for Angkor Wat if that means anything to anybody. My posts from here on in wont be like this; lazy and uncordinated. I'm planning on doing some proper writing and actually explaining what its like. Maybe I'll actually get a few visitors to my site!|*||*|Well thats all for now. The pictures are fully functional. You can see the thumbnails but there are a few that dont work. They should show up however if you view the images in their original size. You can choose what size you want to view the images by clicking on one of the options on the bar above the photograph, after you click on the thumbnail. That probably isnt the greatest explanation, but really, its not that complicated. Smaller numbers means smaller size. |*||*|Also, the old posts arent directly connected to the site anymore, but can be seen at |*||*|"www.drifter.ca/website/html/archives-old/"|*||*|ok.|*||*|Till next post.|*||*||*||*|
