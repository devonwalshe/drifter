Boo, I'm in Saigon.|*||*|Being stared at like you have a penis sticking out of your forehead is only fun for so long.|*||*|After a lot of trouble I got myself onto a local bus that took twice as long as the tourist bus and sat me behind this obnoxious guy my age who would surface from petting his exasperated girlfriend to speak loudly too me in Vietnamese. I've found that Vietnamese people, unlike every single other nationality I've met, have no qualms with explaining things lengthily in a language they know full well you dont understand, then smiling serenely as you stare back at them with a dumb look on your face. For me this is one of many frustrating things I've encountered during my seemingly long second day in this country. Another is the fact that crotchety, shirtless old men with cigerettes dangling from their mouths are consantly screaming at passers by, and that people dont seem to sit in the drivers seat while they drive, they sit on the horn, and apparently steer with their asses. |*||*|Vietnam is a VERY crowded place.  |*||*|I'm too damned tired and frustrated about my University prospects to write anything more. I'll bring the perspective out a little bit tommorow and give my over-reaching observations about life as I've seen it in the Mekong Delta. Oh, that was nice, I've given myself something to write about next time. I should do that every time..|*||*|TTFN
