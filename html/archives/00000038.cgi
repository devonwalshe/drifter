It is now 530 in the morning over here, And I just had the starkest sense of deja-vu. This one I can actually prove. About two months ago, I woke up in my bed in a cold sweat because of a dream that I had just had and that I have just now remembered. The dream was situated in england, with me typing on a generic computer to my girlfriend, katie. We were having a discussion about me leaving, and I had this panicky sense of impending closeness of me leaving. This feeling was coupled by the lonely, nonsensical feeling of being in another country. Together, it felt like I had made a big mistake by coming over here, and I was paying for it by getting grief from katie. When I woke up, I was in my big warm soft bed, with lot's of time to prepare before my big trip, and that feeling of panic just melted away into the warmth of my bed and I'm sure I fell right back asleep. Now tonight, this exact scenario happened. I was speaking to katie online late at night and I am in england, but one thing was missing, I wasn't feeling panicked. This raises the question, should I feel this way, is there something I'm missing that that dream was trying to tell me in advance ? I hope not. Whatever the case, coincedence or not. It's creepy. Maybe it's just late. |*||*|Well on to more routine stuff. I am just heading into town today to continue my job search, it hasn't really started yet as the little town my mum lives in is pretty tiny. This whole country is seperated by little towns interspursed between fields, with a medium sized city every few hundred miles. All the buildings are no more than 50 feet high either, it's really strange to me, coming from a city. there is just nothing like that here, except for the huge metropolises like london. And even that is just not the same. Nothing looks new, everything here is at LEAST 100 years old. It's kind of a good thing, because people really believe in sturdyness here. But to a boy from a city where everything is still shining, it's a little strange to wander in a moss covered world.|*||*|I have uploaded a few pictures and a few movies, the movies won't work yet, I'm sorry everybody i'm working on it. check the pictures out {{link http://www.drifter.ca/pictures/?album=%2Fengland& here}}.
