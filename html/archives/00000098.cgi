I have to say, from what I've seen so far, I'm not impressed.|*||*|Since I entered Vietnam three days ago, I've been paying extra special attention to the things happening around me as I usually do for the first little while in a country, and I've found little to identify with or enjoy here.|*||*|I'm a little bit conflicted because obviously this is a country of 77 million and for one tiny individual (and I am quite small as they go) to give a sweeping condemnation of an entire country would be utter folly. On the other hand, I cant help but be bothered by a number of things.|*||*|So far, I've been lucky enough to have travelled through regions of the world that are renowned for their friendliness. The South Pacific, Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia were all places where a smile would get you through almost ANYTHING. Here I've found my dimply smiling face to be completely inert!. I feel like my secret weapon has been rendered useless. I've found myself beaming at people in the way that I've gotten so used to over the past year or so, and instead of having them returned, I am faced with a stoney countinance that implies they think I am the LOWEST form of life on the planet. This is the first thing that botheres me and it makes a difference because out here, dealing all day every day with the people who want to sell you tours, massages and cyclo rides takes A LOT of patience and a smiling exchange with these people usually helped me to see them as human beings. |*||*|The second thing that bothers me is the way I've seen people interact with eachother, not just tourists. As I have absolutely no hope of grasping even the rudements of Vietnamese, I will not claim to understand what they are saying, but it would seem to me that with all the constricted-throat screaming that goes on, these exchanges must be slightly more confrontational than "hey there buddy!, hows it going!". On my bussride from the border to Saigon there was a man sitting behind me who would periodically stick his head out of the window and scream at random people driving past. Now this man may have been a lunatic, but I've also seen it happen between aqcuantences on the street. Its very abrasive and very intimidating.|*||*|Next, is that on the whole, and I'm sure its painted by my aforementioned observations, the Vietnamese people I've encountered just dont LOOK that nice. Some look downright ferocious or murderous. Faces contorted from decades of frowning or pockmarked sneers fly by on cyclos leaving only questions in thier wake. Every male over the age of 8 seems to have a cigerette dangling from their mouth and an expression of pragmatic apathy cemented to thier faces. |*||*|Last and least of all...|*||*|I also recognize that Vietnamese culture is decidedly more chinese and perhaps I have my own false preconceptions from growing up in Vancouver.
