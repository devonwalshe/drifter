The past few days could be described as boring to the public, but to me they were very relaxing. Because of this I have nothing really to relate regarding my activities. But I have updated my photos for hopefully the last time in polynesia. If I have any luck Ill be in riatea by tommorow, If the cargo ship takes pity on my situation. The itinerary in the about section is also properly uploaded now. well, untill the cooks! (knowing me probably before).
