I'll let you know when I start travelling. |*||*|I mean, I'm moving phisically from place to place, but I thought "backpacking" was so much more than that.|*||*|It is I'm sure, a whole plethora of opportunities at your doorstep, waiting for you to happen upon them and have adventures.......|*||*||*|roooiiiiiigggghhhhhttt..|*||*|my life has been slightly different.|*||*|I felt like every time I got to port through the pacific, I had an impossible list of errands to run, which I would inevitably fail to complete, and then it was on to the middle of nowhere for 3 weeks where they didnt even have a concept of currency.|*||*|I thought this would end with asia. But since I've got here I've had a whole host of errands to run and I now THINK they are completed but whose really to tell. Its bloody frustrating. I seem to be behaving in a completely different way then everyone I meet. But I have a premonition that its over.......|*||*|annnny way. I have a few stories to tell. |*|The good news is that I now have some direction and know where I'm going |*|to go, the bad news is that I have to be back in Phuket in a week.|*||*|Ahhh... root canals in paradise, There is no better way to spend your |*|holiday.|*||*|There is something about having the most inner regions of your mouth |*|being poked, proded and molested by sharp instruments and drills while |*|the smell of burning enamel floats lazily up into your senses that is |*|just so...... so... so....|*||*|wrong.|*||*|Alright, I refused to get a hollow tooth fixed while I could, prolonging |*|and subsequently exacerbating the inevitable. But who wants to |*|intentionally put themselves through pain. Unless something hurts, there |*|is no immediate purpose to getting it fixed, and procrastination is |*|easy.  When it hurts, then you go get it fixed.|*||*||*| ok fine I admit I have no excuse.|*||*|I'm a failure as a human being.|*||*|and I paid for it, financially and physically.|*||*||*|My time in thailand so far has been completely manic.|*||*|After my arrival on the Sailing Yacht : Condesa that I have been with sice Darwin, I stayed in the (from what I had heard) ultra trendy beach resort of "kata beach". So in this case, and I have a feeling this is also true in other regions of thailand read "ultra trendy beach resort" as "my worst nightmare".|*||*|But as I had "business" (another serious nightmare: bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz) to take care of, I had to be there. And i shockingly found out that I had to be BACK there in what is now a few days.|*|What did I do with my time there. |*||*|I walked around. |*||*|Yes thats right. I have no friends, I have no companions. I talked to no-one but the intrusive nepalese suit salesmen that jump down your throat at any opportunity. But one thing of note, actually a few things of notable noteriety happened, but I'm just going to tell you one for now.|*||*|I had gotten used to the harrassment that follows around any young white male here. |*||*||*||*|... ok hang on a second here,|*||*|stop the train.......|*||*|let me level with you.|*||*|I'm exausted.|*||*|I've travelled nearly 3000 ks over the last two days, stressed myself out beyond what I thought was possible and ate twice in a 60 hour period.|*||*||*|and now i"m drunk tired and I want to go to bed.|*||*|So I'll continue this later.|*||*|bye|*|
