Oh god yes, I am getting ready for my world trip, and it's crazy.|*|I have so much stuff to be done, It's rediculous, I really don't know how i'm going to do it all.|*|For those of my family relations and friends, I will do a brief fill in of the things I have been doing and have to do. |*||*|I have being and am working on my graduation so I can apply at university In scotland.|*||*|I have been working throught the process of buying a house.|*||*|I have been trying really hard to find a boat for me to crew on, but to no serious avail as of yet.|*||*|And i've been working, all these things are mucho funo. I can guarantee. Whatever the process, In a few months, I will be lying on the deck of a boat crossing some of the most remote and beautiful places on this big blue planet. I will have so much time to relax and kick back I won't even know what to do withmyself, so it is this thought that I cling to. I would also like to take this opportunity to apoligize fore the quality of my writing on this page. For some reason I have found myself writing more or less in vernacular tounge, while I would rather be filling it with my usual overly verbose language, but perhaps while I am actually using this site for it's purpose on my journey, it will change as I have more time to contemplate my posts, but untill then, for those of you that check out my site, drop me a line and tell me about it, the link is right down there, below the post.|*||*|
