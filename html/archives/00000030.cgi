Well, The site is officially on the internet. At this time, which you can see below, the name "drifter.ca" doesn't point to the site, but in a couple of hours, the registry should pick it up and start routing it here. So technically, this is the first post while the site's on the interenet, but by no means finished. |*|I don't know how long it will take me to get everything wired around here, It shouldn't be too long if i persevere. While your waiting though, there's always plenty of <a href="http://fark.com">Fark</a> to go around. enjoy.
