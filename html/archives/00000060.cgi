This will be my last dispatch from the bastard country that serves little other international purpose than interfacing two of the worlds largest bodies of water. We leave mid afternoon for a month of guerilla rum drinking ( the official bahai line says no to the evils of alcohol), weakening my already underdeveloped skull plates ( a joke devined at the bar referring to my many infantile qualities ) on the various low beams on the boat and many, many hours of watching my toenails grow. Stepping off the plane two weeks ago seems like a dream I have just recently woken from, fading clandestinely, like a poloroid in reverse. Since then, so many things seen, so many things done, and I have barely begun my journey. I now leave behind a country. On such a massive scale are my actions now, trapsing around the world, showing up in a country, making appearances here and there all over it, then heading off without another glance backwards. Who am I to so lightly turn my back from such a multitude of information, culture, and experience. But such is travelling, this perversly selfish action inextricable from the whole. Id better get used to it. On the other hand, I want to hang on to as much of it as possible, unfortunately, I only have a small pack, so bringing the vestiges in physical form is impossible, so I must solidify it in as much quantity as I can, in the only quality I can; the written word. |*||*|So it goes, I leave behind a joint military and police force, a bunch of kids who look scared shitless of the automatic rifles they hold in their hands, wonderfully cheap fruit, salsa music, and trade it in for a month of salty air, confined spaces and a chance to sleep in the worlds first perpetual motion contraption. Lucky me.|*||*|For anyone who wishes to keep track of my progress, We will be logging on to a radio database daily, providing them with information that they pass on to the operators of this website : www.bitwrangler.com/yotreps. who provide a map where our progress will be monitered.The ships name is ¨dawnbreaker II¨ and hopefuly we will be listed within the next couple of days.|*||*|I cant believe I have another year of this shit.
