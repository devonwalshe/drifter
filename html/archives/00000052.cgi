Im heading out from panama city today towards colon where well get on the boat and start scrubbin'. we have  A LOT of work to do, but truthfully Im looking forward to it. its the kind of work you can take pride in because you know its going to make your life a lot easier for the next month or so, where we'll definetely need it. So no picture update as of yet, I only have a few, I guess Ill get one of the main panama strip, but theres really not all THAT much too see after youve gotten the jist of all the palm trees. Ill see if I can get a portrait of an indian in colon. I hope we can find a good place to use computers in colon, on the whole the city is pretty sketch, I forgot to tell you how when you walk by an ally, the wretchedness of shit, piss and garbage swarms and engulfs you like a blanket of filth. eeyyeechhh. it was nasty.  cheers for now.|*|
