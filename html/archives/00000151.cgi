Somewhere in a northern french port, an unshaven foreign young man walks aimlessly through the forgotten empty spaces between a confusing jumble of transport routes.|*||*|Its strange to remember the way people look at you when your walking down the side of a road that clearly isnt meant to be walked on.|*||*|I've had a very interesting first day. Everything is coming back to me. I couldn't help chuckling to myself as I waved back at a woman looking worryingly at me through a ground floor office window. She worked in the port authority reception and had arranged for a taxi to take me to the shipping office that I had asked after. I remembered as I got into the vehicle that something about my face and my demeanor seemingly gives women an undeniable desire to mother me, a suspicion that has worked to my benefit countless times over the past few years.|*||*|The most vivid recollection is how much of all of my travelling success relies completely and wholley on the kindness of others. |*||*|I was planning on a detailed description of how my day has panned out thus far, but considering that I am ready to turn this god-forsaken french keyboard into an electronic casserole through means of extreme violence, I think not. They have been less rude than expected, but I still find the insatiable desire to develop completely different systems for common things a distinctly infuriating characteristic of the french nation. Ironic that as the brits celebrate the 200th anneversary of the battle of the trafalger, I am forced to lament a failed attempt to rule the world. Old ideas and historical hang-ups are so boring and counterproductive.|*||*||*|On the other hand, thank fuck for the metric system.|*||*|On another page, it turns out I speak french! This is odd considering i dont remember learning it at school (was permanently kicked out of the entire french program for humiliating my teacher on a daily basis) and only really spent a few weeks in french speaking places on my trip. |*||*|strange, but helpful.|*||*|strange, but wonderful.|*||*|For the sake of my own sanity, here is my day in list format:|*||*|patchy, fitfull sleep aboard a p&o ferry across the english channel, broken up with pisstake amongst the crew members.|*||*|announce my presence at the port authority, and establish at least the 500th mother on my trip.|*||*|Get driven by a taxi driver to security, who sends me somewhere else. I give everybody a hard time (body language can be devastating) due to the taxi meter continuing to run. |*||*|Finally get past security and dropped off by the now crestfallen taxi driver. he pouts and takes 50 cents off my fare. a small victory.|*||*|I meet my man, mr. Boyanvalle, with a chest like a bear and a face like a hawk he jokingly pretends not to speak english. |*||*|He lets me leave my bag at the office and tells me to phone him at 22 00. its time to go to town.|*||*|Wander like a true vegabond through the byways of the industrial trading purgatory that is Le Harve port before ending up at bustop with an intimidatingly large, costumed west african man.|*||*|I observe the strangely located rundown shanties that appear to be a small oasis of humanity amongst a sea of lifeless industrialisation. The broken windows,  prams, and multiple children on single bicycles prove this to be true, and i begin to be nervous.|*||*|The bus arrives, and carries me half dozing to the center of town, where I wander to a park and fall asleep under a tree reading a short story by Marquez.|*||*|I end up eating, then going to an internet cafe, where I have just realised that i have been completely and utterly theiving of another mans writing style.|*||*|Worse crimes have been committed.|*||*|For instance this fucking keyboard.|*||*|I've had enough.|*||*|I'll (hopefully) be jumping on this banana boat this evening, arriving in martinique in around 11 days. To entertain myself, I will read, exercise, kid around with the crew, play my guitar, listen to music, and reflect on what a rediculous thing I am doing to the ever soothing ambience of the ocean waves washing up against the hull of my ship.|*||*|We'll catch up in the Caribbean.|*||*|TTFN
