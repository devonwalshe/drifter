So, I'm just about in the middle of the increasingly prolix Tibetan post.|*||*|I am also just about to leave for India, which means that I wont be able to continue the post for another few days yet.|*||*|I've had a very very crazy time in Kathmandu. It is a city that defies all ration or convention. The vast majority of the central area exists as tight walkways with ever honking traffic, crooked, collapsing brick buildings with aged wood ornaments built into it, random ornaments for hindu gods at every turn and  dusty (or muddy) unpaved roads. Its a rediculous state of affairs that cant last for long in the new global era, and I'm damn glad I caught it while its still here.|*||*|India is going to be a whole other bag of worms, and to be honest, I'm suspecting another fit of depression will strike me at some point and I'll have to get over it all over again. |*||*|So thats where I'm at, getting into the swing of posting often and plentifully, and taking pictures like a shutterbug on crystal meth.|*||*|Look forward to hearing a shout from the city of the sick and dying,|*||*|Dev.|*||*|TTFN|*||*|
