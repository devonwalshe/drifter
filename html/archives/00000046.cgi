here we go, the long awaited update. I'm back in vancouver now, amidst a flurry of activity. Obviously now since I'm back in proper civilization, I have been able to fix up the site to its previous grandiose splendor. Still not at the point where I'm happy to leave it and jet off, but closer. My reaction to being back in Vancouver is mixed. On the one hand, I'm so glad to be back in a place where people extend such selfless kindness towards eachother. On the other, I'm frustrated as hell that we have no idea what's going on in our country outside of what some obscure backbencher MP said under her breath. I pose this question to all of the canadians reading this. Does anyone know what they were talking about at the cabinet meeting she was departing?. I don't, because the media just doesnt report what goes on in the cabinet meetings here. It's pathetic. Political transparancy in Canada is seriously lacking, and the media just exacerbates the problem. I miss all the intelectuals in Britain. But I certainly do not miss much else. I just wish Canada could get itself off its ass and become the world power it deserves to be.|*||*|I leave around the 20th I believe, getting a flight from here to panama is turning out to be a rediculous price, I'm going to have to find some sheisty way to do it. Maybe a bus to L.A. and then a Flight from there. |*||*|I'm really busy provisioning and getting packed up, but If anyone wants to get in touch with me before I leave I would still suggest phoning me because it's going to get a lot harder to talk to me after I'm gone!. |*||*|Jet-lag calls me to the bed|*||*|Dev
