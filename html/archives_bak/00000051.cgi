I dont have very long to write this because its late and Im getting shunted of the computadoro. I had a very eventful day. I opened the door for the other crew and we recognized eachother quick. we had some food then took a bus up to colon which is seriously up there on the worlds most dangerous cities list. Food here is astoundingly cheap. 1 american dollar will get you proper fed, i got a burger and a pop for that, and two big peices of chicken with lots of rice for the same in colon. the country is absolutely beautiful. every single inch of the poor leached soil in the country is filled with a thick layer of dense jungle foiliage. Its an absolute marvel to look at, especially for someone whose from canada. In colon we met up with the skipper and took a look at the boat. the long and short of it is, its going to take a lot of work, but hes got all the good stuff on the boat. hes got at least three of everything important, its actually really funny how safe he is. Hes a proper old sea dog, you guys will get pictures of him. I maybe wont be able to do a full picture update for a while, but we'll see how things go. Pete, the other crew is also really funny and smart, and I dont think we wont see any captain bligh action. we've got outdoor speakers and a full out sterio system in there, Ive got my mp3 player and me and pete both have guitars, so we´ll be blasting our way accross the pacific. it looks as though were going to be going downwind the entire way there, which is just fabulous ( as all the yachties reading this will know)The timeframe is a little dodgy, we wont leave untill later this week, and theres no solid estimate on how long it will take us to get there. enough of the soft stuff, heres the good stuff|*||*|I got my second good hit of poverty today, man panama has some good shit. hahaha. Colon is what life would be like if nobody sobered up after a night of drugs and booze to go to work. like people are just fucking and drinking and snorting to forget about doing the things that are necesary for life. everything is fenced off and broken, the people are filled with holes that have healed over. we got sent down some side streat at night trying to get to the bus which was totally dodgy. but I loved it. Still, life feels like life, children still smile shyly at you when you smile at them, and people seem  like they get on with there lives. I'd really like to find out how things are done here. there's the presidential elections coming up and you see all the combatants faces pasted all over the country. just from looking, you would seriously question how above the board they are. ok I'm getting the evil eye. hope I can update soon.
