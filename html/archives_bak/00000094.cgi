After a day that defies description, I have arrived in Vietnam. I'm not going to spend much time in this country, but enough to leave a little bit of flavour on my tastebuds. The rough plan from here on sends me to laos, a hard brutal transit through "colder than a witches tit" regions of communist China and leaves me in India some time in March. We'll see how that goes. I know very little of what to expect in my first communist country. Only the passage of time will tell.
