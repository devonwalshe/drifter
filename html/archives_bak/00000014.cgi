{{link http://www.thehumorarchives.com/attachment_files/FINGER.jpg" puke, disgusting, ugly, gagging, hideous, putrid.}} (link not for weak stomachs) All these things i do know about the look. I don't like it either, but the good thing is, I've got it all tabled out. Colors will change. The images.... will change. The layout... will not change. I'm going to have an archy thing, with some-sort of multicultural pillars beside, interconnected with the nav-bar, which will be below the title bar. I'm really questioning what I need here. I'm going to go down to the public library and check out pictures of cultural designs, make some copies, then use them to work off. The end result will be a lot more elaborite then what we have here. no worries. Till next time nobodies.
