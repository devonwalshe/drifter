I hate not speaking spanish, I feel like an absolute invalid. So here I am in panama city, at the waiting station(AKA voyager hostel) doing just precicely that. The flights were more or less uneventful with just moderately interesting counterparts next to me. On the flight from Salt lake city to atlanta, I had this health food freak who put all sorts of ¨nutritional suppliments¨ in my drink. he was so funny. arriving in panama I had a close call leaving my passport on the plane (the mother gasps). but I got picked up by a nice american expat in a rediculously nice car who gave me a ride to the hostel. On the way we hit two toll stations, which gives me a feeling that things here are just a scramble to get some public money together. along the highway on the side, in the middle of a soupy muddy muck-filled hell was a shanty town and you could see right into the mess of windows and see the people sitting doing whatever on a saturday night. It looked like a big mess of corrugated wafers all piled on top of eachother with random extrusions. Ahhh.... my first taste of poverty. This city is actually surprisingly tame. Except for single white girls, they get harrassed as would be pretty much expected. people have been nice and I´m just waiting on Peter scanlon, the other crew on the boat, and richard neufeld to give me a heads up and tell me whats going on, I may have to bunk another night here, which I would be more than comfortable with, very nice and safe. I appreciated all the emails, keep em coming or just post on the site, I'll respond to either, but if I get inundated with emails, who knows. I think I will be able to take some pictures later in the day and upload them with this computer.. hopefully. but untill then keep it real wherever you are.
