I am literally walking out the door, finale finito the absoluetly positively 100% leaving this time. I'm big time rusho, so I have to a go-o. It looks like I have gotten some good intelligence about panama, so I'll be safe as far as that goes. *note* the pictures thumbs don't work so don't stress, it'll be fixed soon. Give me all your mailing adresses so I can send you strange things from around the world. Wish me luck!|*||*|Devon
