Reading my old posts is excruciating.|*||*||*|No more of this silly bullshit.|*||*||*|My brain feels like a fucking beached whale, withering into a dry lump of foul fleshy muck in the absence of familiarity.|*||*||*|I could not humanly care less about the souless people out there who manage to go years without acknowledging their origins. Right now, All I want is to go home and see my family.|*||*|I want to sit on the porch with a drink in my hand and return the blank stare that dog ambling yuppies send my way. Perhaps even confuse them with a smile and a wave.|*||*|I want to psychologically abuse my little brother, then spend two days second guessing myself as a result of his effortless abasement of my value as a human being in reply.|*||*|I want to wake up to the sound of my moms jangling bangles in the kitchen. At 4 in the afternoon.|*||*|I can't wait to see what 2 years of my families lovable and familiar negligence has done to my stuff.|*||*||*|Increasingly frequent photographic commitments are getting me down, need to begin instituting a form of quality control. |*||*|Pray for the shipping gods to be kind to me, as I'm not quite in a state to swim to Panama.|*||*|ttfn|*|
