After a long pilgrimage consisting of Beer, Beaches and Blue Sky I have finally arrived at the Backpacker Mecca. |*||*|Khao San Road.|*||*||*|I was actually quite excited to get here. So many of the people I have travelled with have been here, and the stories about the place are legendary. They say there is the highest concentration of backpackers in the world here, and arriving at 5 AM, there were enough about at that time even to put no question to the claim. Its only 6AM now, but I just wanted to announce to the world (which is nobody whose listening) that I'm here and not so queer. Wish me luck in the City of Sin.
