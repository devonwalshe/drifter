I'm leaving today for the great expedition. I train today to the Border with Pakistan. I should be there tommorow. After that, I will have to get my Afghanistan Visa in Islamabad, then I'm off to Afghanistan. There I will try to get my Iran Visa, and then I will work my way through Afghanistan to Iran. Once I have finished in Iran, I will travel non-stop from the Turkish/Iranian border to Paris hopefulling arriving in time to meet my little brother and friends.|*||*|I shouldn't have to say it, but Im not going to have a lot of internet access, but anytime that I have a chance to get on, I will make sure to update and I'm planning on giving detailed accounts of the places that I'm visiting. |*||*|So that means I can have no loose strings like the Visa madness story.|*||*|Basically after yelling at the british lady, I went to the Pakistani Embassy, and they basically told me that they didnt care. Nice. I then simpered over to the Canadian HC, pleaded my case to them, and as they were at the very least polite to me, I handed over the money, and they told me to come back at 4PM for the letters.|*||*|I was seriously demoralized and decided that hanging around embassyville for too long would make me kill myself, so I limped back home in my pathetic state. The next day I picked up the letters early and made my application at the Pakistani High Commision. |*||*|Long story short, I have the Visa now in my Canadian Passport, yet I am currently travelling in India on my British Passport. This means trouble at the border. You should have seen the cruel looks that the Pakistani HC clerks gave me when I asked about this. They were just too happy to take my money and not care what happened at ther border. Bastards, all of them.|*||*||*|So thats me. I'm off on the craziest expedition I have yet devised on my trip. Crazier that the Tibet one I think, and hope in in my small masochistic way.|*||*||*|Wish me luck and may Allah be with me.|*||*|TTFN|*|
