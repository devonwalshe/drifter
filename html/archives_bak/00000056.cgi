well, here I am, in an upscale bar having the national beer and typing at the same time. Im trying hard to concentrate and not look at the gyrating latinas beside me. It took us two days to get through the canal because we slept in the morning we were supposed to get to the locks, typical. going though them was a unforgettable experience. take any bond movie, and there we were, floating amidst all of this gargantuan machinary. the sheer scale of it is enough to humble the most accomplished of engineers, it was very interesting to see it all happening. I got a lot of sun on the crossing, we got some pictures of me, pete and a very nice couple from nocal who were line-handling with us, it turns out theyre going to be staying on our boat while we stock up and provision. so for mom, there you are, my first hairy bit and im completely safe, but your not alone, pete is 27 and his mom was even checking out the webcam at the downward portion of the locks for us. If i had known I would have sent out the word. mind you, it would be hard to recognize my skin tone, im like a lobster despite the spf 45 ive been putting on. well as I am in a bar and have other things to tend to, ill leave the elaborite details for my next update, ttfn.|*||*|
