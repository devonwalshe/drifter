I love cities. |*||*|I feel comfortable in them like i dont feel comfortable anywhere else in the world. Also the fact that things are rediculously cheap compared to the rest of the country (read 15 cents for a coke rather than 25), and there is no limit to the beautiful places to see in the city make it nice. I took a boat ferry down the central river in Bangkok, and I couldnt help but notice the similarity to the Thames in London. The exception was there was Bhuddest temples erupting on the banks and the boats had pointy roofs. I came to the conclusion that somebody tossed a whole bunch of chilli powder into the themes and then moved it here and called it Bangkok, or Krung Thep as the locals say. |*||*|I'm living like a roman in my hostel as well, three movies a day, cheap food, little laying cushions for you to sleep and eat on. ohhhh.. |*||*|Will do a full update tommorow with my pictures. I ended up going down to pat pong, the imfamous red light district here in Bangkok and saw things no little boy like me should see. |*||*|God I'm not going to be a teenager in around 19 days. What a shocker.|*||*||*|Till tommorow.
