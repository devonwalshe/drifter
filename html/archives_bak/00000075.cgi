I'm in Singapore. If you have seen the jetsons, you have seen Singapore, just imagine everybodies eyes with a little more <I>shape.</I> |*||*||*|THAT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ENTERTAINING.|*||*|I refer to my brain vomit sent out from darwin.|*||*|please read it for its historical value, rather than any attempt to entertain with wit and candour. Because if it was, I would suck. |*||*|In fact, I purposly make this slightly nonsensical, on purpose, to distance myself from the responsibility of actually <I>trying</I> to make it good, which would lay my writing bare and make it vulnerable to critisism. My own would hurt the most I think...|*||*||*|I'm a wiley one arn't I???|*||*|But I promise, while I will never put in the effort (not on this website anyway) in to write something that I would actually stand behind, I will still try to make it as entertaining as possible on the fly.|*||*|I dunno, maybe I'll start composing stuff... |*||*|depends what asia turns out to be. |*||*|anyway, busisness.....|*||*|will follow up in an epic session and get caught up, (it looks like the site will be up from now on, I'm changing servers). Then I will in more detail describe my present surroundings. |*||*|Is it a date?....|*||*|The scooters here actually make that BRRRRRRRR sound like the hover cars....|*||*|I have now seen 15 escalators, full of people, right next to eachother.|*||*|I have now seen residential complex "zone c" north; a big square conglomeration of concrete housing what I estimated as nearly 5000 people in tiny little squares inside the big ugly square.|*||*|<I>there are hundreds of them|*||*|all right next to eachother</I>|*||*|spooky..|*||*|i'm getting carried away.|*||*|goodbye
