I've been attacked.|*||*|Mobbed.|*||*|Robbed.|*||*|It happened as soon as I crossed the border.|*||*||*|Its India.|*||*||*||*|This place is launching a full scale attack on reality. I dont know why it can't just play nice and exist in a way that at least RESEMBLES sense and reason. But it doesnt. |*||*|Nonsense, all of it. |*||*||*|I've only been cajoled into yelling at people twice. I figure thats not so bad considering how many times I FELT like doing it. |*||*|But what it means is that my signature patience is waning. I can feel the control slipping out from beneath my fingers, and all the bad things I watch other tourists do will start to work their way into my behaviour.|*||*|Its ok though. I have been expecting this and I knew India wasnt going to be easy. And so far, it hasnt been THAT bad. My only consolation is that typically, I get along fabulously with Indian people. We've got the same sense of humor. |*||*|I figure that I'm going to stay off the streets for a week or two, kind of give myself a little bit of a cusioning before I hit the hard. Kind of like easing yourself into a hot-tub. Little little, then fast fast. |*||*|So I realize that this is about as scattered as a cubist portrait, but then again, so is my brain at the moment. I feel completely disoriented. Almost dizzy in a waking way.|*||*||*|As I mentioned before, I feel totally out of control and that is a very unusual feeling for me. Once I get my bearings and a sense for the pace of life here, I'll be golden. It might just take a few days or weeks.|*||*||*|This is just a kind of little, "hello, I've arrived in La-La land" post, my next one will be a real one. A continution of the Tibet Saga. Hopefully a conclusion as well.|*||*||*|TTFN
