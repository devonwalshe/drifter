Make all the colon jokes now while Im still here. yes yes, the canal leading out from colon, Im floating around colon, the colon canal. colon is one big dirty hole. I spent the day in panama city yesterday with the plan of running errands, too bad for us it bieng sunday, I guess we can thank the conquistadors and missionaries for that one. you get churches and processions all over the place here, singing, dancing, bringing all the latin gusto to jesus. Hed probably shit his pants. Im for sure leaving through the canal tommorow morning, the boat looks ship shape, except for those little buggers that got what was coming too them yesterday. I was sitting on board having a few with some friends on another boat, and I felt a slight tingling, and looked down and there was a cockroach on my bloody knee! we got him good, but we had seen a few more, Ive got some pictures, we got some roach killer and well fumigate the place later today. I think after all the cleaning we must have destroyed one of there little hotels or settlements. After passing through the canal like a bunch of turds through the bowels of the americas, we will provision and then set off, we are heading straight through to the marquesas non-stop, skipping the galapagos unfortunately. we should be there in about a month. Im positive in my ability to get some pictures up while were in panama city, so look forward to those, as far as getting the thumbnails working, who knows, its up to the bastards who host my site. Im having a great time chowing down on empanadas and having religious experiences with the pinapples. look forward  to the pictures.
