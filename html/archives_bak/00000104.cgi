My time in Laos will be short. I've been in South East Asia for about three and a half months and I'm feeling the need to leave. I find myself thinking that every day I spend here I could have another day in India, the long awaited focus of my entire trip. So I've decided to go as quickly as possible to that place, stopping off for a quick jaunt up to Everest base camp along the way. The route is taking me through Tibet and China; I'm sure I'll get a feeling for those places as I drift through them. As for my impressions of Laos, so far I dont know what to say. Its historical name was the "land of a million elephants" and during the Vietnam war was given the moniker "Land of a million irrelevents". I wish I didnt know this coming in to the country because so far nothing interesting has happened and this has painted all my observations about the country. I get a feeling of sameness from this place. The poverty here is apparent, but not severe, the people seem to behave like Thais and  it looks a little bit like Cambodia. I dont know what to make of it. I'm sure there is something unique to Laos that will show itself to me. I'll just have to wait.
