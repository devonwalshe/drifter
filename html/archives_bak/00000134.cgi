I'm making a run for the hills. I sent my visa application in to the Iranian Embassy yesterday and it will take anywhere from 5 to 15 days. The latter could pose some pretty largish problems. But I have a few days to kill and I'm heading up to Bamiyan, the site of the Giant Buddha statues that were destroyed by the Taliban. So no full update today. I'll give one when I get back in a few days. Wish me luck. |*||*|TTFN.
