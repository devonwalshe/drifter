So, I didnt get as much writing on my site done as I had planned, but I gave a couple updates and fixed a bunch of things on other parts of the site, so I feel satisfied.|*||*||*|The long and the short of it is that I'm leaving tommorow morning for Bangladesh. Bangladesh for those who dont know has the highest population density in the world and is in the top ten for lowest GDP per capita. Every Monsoon season, around July or August, about three quarters of the country floods and decimates swaths of rural areas and paralyzes the country for about a month or more. |*||*|This happens every year, like clockwork. I'm going in the build up to the Monsoon, just as its going to be getting a little hot.|*||*|Apparently whatever time of the year, sheer insanity is to be expected in everything you observe in Bangladesh. From the streets, to the crowds,  to the running of the country. I'm not trying to expect anything except crowds of people following me around. Whatever happens, I'll write about it. |*||*|Maybe I'll satiate the masses as well and tell the story of whats been keeping me in Calcutta, We'll see in Dakha.|*||*|Wish me luck.|*||*|TTFN
