I앐 going to just put my location at the top from now, because I wont always explain it in the message, who needs pretentious titles anywho. Speaking of pretentious, I앐 going to take that bloody face of mine off the index of the site and replace it with something else unless I get 30 000 emails telling me they like my retarded, quasi-thoughtfull look on my face plastered on the front of the site. As for the good info, I앐 in colon again for the next 8 days. It sounds like a lot, but holy shit do we have a lot of work to do on the baot. only 4 or 5 major outfits, but for the most part it압 just tidying and organizing. I앐 really looking forward to getting on the boat and just relaxing. It앏l be work during the crossing because it압 all shift work and you have to keep your wits about you, but once we hit the marqueses in the south pacific it압 going to be all barbeques, snorkling, music and guitar playing with the backdrop of remote tropical atolls. I앐 sanguine. I앏l take pictures tommorow and get some good shots, I think it won앖 be too much trouble updating from one of these internet cafe압 so I앏l do a picture update of panama sometime later in the week so you can all get a taste of it. By then the thumbnails should be working(I앐 haggling even now with the cable monkeys). and I앏l fix the video section. No new shocking observations today, well none that are impersonal enough to share, so I앏l come back with some political goodness in a couple days. |*|
