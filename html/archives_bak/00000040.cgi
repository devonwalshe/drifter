Ok, time for a new update. No new progress on the photo gallery as of yet, sorry but internet access has been a bit dodgy over here for the last lilttle while. I will add pictures when it's fixed. I've got two jobs now, I've only worked shifts at one of them, and it sucks. really mean/just plain bad supervisor. But whatever you have to do to pay the bills. The other employee's that work there are nice though, which makes working not so bad. I have a shift at the other one tommorow night. More japanese/korean wackyness <a href=http://www.seanbaby.com/nes/naughty02.htm>here.</a> Nothing more really to say, over and out.

Now you all have a choice, either there is no 800x800 resize option and all the pictures load really fast, or they all load really slow and that option is choosable. I think the first way is best, but oh well.
