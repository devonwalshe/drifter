I'm fighting off a creative hangover. Its finding new and perverse ways to torture me and make me collide with stationary objects. I feel a little bit ashamed to be having fun in a place like this. Its like Cancun or Mazatlan. Malliorca or Ibiza for the Euros. I feel like a gorgon when I go down to the beach, there is no way that this many naked women with immaculate figures should exist in such concentration and proximity. I'm worried my frail and delicate perception of reality will spiral violently out of control. The alcohol probably isnt saving any african children either.|*||*|OK it could be worse.|*||*|I'll try and paint the picture accurately when I finally catch up.|*||*|Tonight is the full moon. Its going to get messy. I took a few photo's last night that I'm just uploading now.|*||*|The full moon party goes on all night so redbull and anything alcoholic is pretty much par for the course with people. The redbull here costs 40 cents and is about 4 times as strong as the stuff back home. Liquid anphetamine would be an accurate description.|*||*|God I'm a useless human being. I'm too shy to talk to anybody. I did meet three nice young canadians from coquitlem who I am drinking with tonight though.... I'm going to make an effort to take a lot of photos. Hopefull I can get the essence right . Its pretty disgusting for the most part.|*||*|BTW I'm pretty well convinced that noones reading this so if you are, a comment now and again wouldnt be like clubbing a baby seal. It might even make my day.|*||*|not that this is supposed to be entertaining or informative... :)|*||*||*|till next time.
