Alright, I promise everybody that this will be the very last post regarding the status of my site and dealing with it. I have decided to scrap the old layout design. I have decided that it was ,*shudder*, too ambitious. I couldn't properly describe what that does to the perfectionist ogre that is a permanent resident in my brain. He get's very angry and hits the walls believing that there is no such thing as "overly ambitious" and that anyone who utters such words are failures that should be hit with his club. Hence I have a headache. But I have done what I could with simplicity in mind, clinging to the mantra, "Strenth in simplicity". Having said all this, I am very close to being done, with a few pages to wrap up, a few changes to make, then It should all be humming along ready to go, I suspect I shouldn't be done until sometime into the england expedition. For those who may not know, I am going to england on wednesday the eigth of january, for two months to work and gather some more cash for my trip. I am going to try to enable posting for my entries, so that way, If anyone is so inclined, they may discuss what I have written with the others who have seen it, or write something about it in there critiqueing me. For the guys at work, I have a couple links for you, <a href="http://drifter.ca/photo/New%20Years/107-0764_MVI.AVI">crazy sahil</a> and <a href="http://drifter.ca/photo/New%20Years/107-0774_MVI.AVI">crazy vineet </a>. I suspect the two appendeges of my site that will be most updated and therefore important, are this page, and the photo gallery. So I demand that you all check my site right after you all bow towards mecca to pray for allah. Remember, that's 5 times a day. And I don't care if your foreheads hurt, 5 times a day was the bargain. Thank you. Hope you all enjoy.
