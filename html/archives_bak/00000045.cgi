Strange email activity been going on. I've had a few emails from people that didn't think were even aware of my site. I'm not discouraged, or depressed or anything of the sort, I'm quite resistant to those sorts of feelings. These online treatises are just representations of **certain** emotions and thoughts I'm having. Not a sum total of my psychological state. I'm just working through the motions of learning how to express certain complex thoughts and feelings in written form. It's a skill I admire very much. On the flip side of the email strangeness; Is it exam time in Canada or something, I've sent out a bunch of emails and got one back :(. cmon people.|*||*|The rally in London was huge, I've got pictures and soundbytes that I'm going to post later on in the day. I have a strange relationship with these things, I go, I observe, but I don't completely take part. I want to sound out the characteristics of political assertion before I really get my feet wet, as I will one day. I fear that If I just jump in to any movement that piques my interest, It will take away from the purity and strength of my political motives. But I know, that one day I will make a decision, and then fight. Fight untill the day I die, or untill there is no more fighting to be done. Till then, I will just observe and learn.|*||*|The sand is running thin.|*||*||*|
