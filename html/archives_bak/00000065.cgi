Ok, this big Island isnt so bad. I was having serious doubts, the capital, Papeete is a big giant shithole, but Ive been driven around for the past few days by a few londoners with funny accents and seeing what it has to offer. Doesnt add up to the marqueses, but its nice.|*||*|The run down is like this, since the last rondezvous, I have worked on a super yacht with a great crew, gotten way too inebreated at a dock party with beer flowing. Staying on a email friends boat. then, after the work was gone and our friend moved over to another anchorage, we checked into a hostel and met a bunch of great people there. The next day I went out and chilled at the beach where I regained some of my boat tan. Thank god for the french and their lax beach attire rules. Then yesterday, we had a crazy day out driving around playing in the surf, breaking open coconuts, swimming in waterfall pools (it was so beautiful!!!!!) and playing in the surf. At night we had a mock proper dinner ( pete had to eat out of a frisbee) and got loaded of cheap boxed wine. we ended up at the waterfront, playing guitar to a crowd of around 30 tahitians, and out of nowhere, one of the kids uncles showed up and put us all to shame. A bunch of them already had guitars and it was a proper drunken jam session. Such a blast.|*||*|The good news today is that while I was screwing around the island, Pete got us a place boat sitting, so now were stayign for free, and on a boat while we look for a boat, its just fantastic. |*||*|I just charged my battery for my camera, so I will upload the pictures shortly ( seriously ) .|*||*|Be prepared for ted.|*||*||*|***postscript***|*||*|photos uploaded, itinerary updated|*|
