=== 1.3 ===
1) security-related fixes
* Rebuilding Files no longer exposes author username and password
    + uses a token file written to disk which is cleaned up at the end of the rebuild
    + passes a reference to that token instead
    + this keeps author usernames/password out of server and proxy logs, and out
    of browser history. 
    + knowledge of the token will not grant access since it expires.
* &gm_phphackcheck improved in several ways
    + now catches all PHP alternative delimiter styles: <?php ?> <? ?> 
    <% %> and <script language="php"> </script>
    + catches other forms of comment XSS attacks as well
    + now logs to control panel log--with a config setting to
    disable this logging (gm-phphacklog.cgi file now obsolete)
    + now emails the comment email recipient list with a hack attempt 
    notice-- with a config setting to disable this behavior
    + some variable renaming bugs were cleaned up from patch to 1.21d
    + &gm_phphackcheck is now called much earlier in the script
* tag removal from comments made significantly more robust
    + now catches any tags containing spaces (and attributes) previously
    + still can't really catch nested tags cleanly, however, 
    <script></script> is now intercepted by &gm_phphacklog
* &gm_searchresults now improved for XSS issues
    + now converts < and > to entites before printing the search string
    + search string is still passed to the regex unmodified
* passwords are stored in an encrypted form in gm-authors.cgi
    + for compatibility and upgrade purposes, plaintext passwords are still 
    supported, which allows for a "password reset" by modifying gm-authors.cgi 
* search function input is examined before passing to the search code
    + solves issues with special characters causing the search function to crash       

2) feature improvements
* upgrade routine improved
    + removed "cannot determine version setup" issues
    + upgrade recognizes recent versions, including the versions with 
    encrypted passwords
* included emoticons (smilie hack)
    + includes clickable smilies on "add an entry" page
    + includes clickable smilies on comment page
    + emoticons can be disabled on a per-entry basis
* added emoticons path to configuration
    + allows use of {{emoticonspath}} in templates
* changed number of entries being rebuilt from 20 to 10
    + reduces load while rebuilding
* &gm_saveconfigurationdr added to have gm save the config when going to the D&R screen
    + removes the step of having to save the config and then go back to run the D&R
* added music input for entries
    + allows use of {{entrymusic}} variable in entry related templates
    + {{smartentrymusic}} template allows you to repurpose the field for 
    something else, and that label that won't display if the music field 
    is left blank on that entry
* added mood input for entries
    + allows use of {{entrymood}} variable in entry related templates
    + {{smartentrymood}} template allows you to repurpose the field for 
    something else, and that label that won't display if the music field 
    is left blank on that entry
* new {{smartentrymusic}} and {{smartentrymood}} templates
    + allow you to define your own label for the entry music and mood fields
    + will not display the label if the fields are blank for an entry
* new CSS-based default template set
    + radically improves the look of a fresh install
    + easier to modify since the stylesheet rules are in the header template
    + uses most of the new template variables and new templates      
* new Date Grouping Footer template
    + allows you to use the Date Grouping Header template to open a <div> or other
    element, which you can close in the Date Grouping Footer template, allowing
    significantly improved grouping of entries by date  
    + the corresponding template also appears in archive pages as well
* new miscellaneous templates: Smartlink Target Template and Comment Smartlink Target Template
    + allow you to specify a target frame for the {{*smartlink}} variables, specifically
    allows using target="_blank" to make commenters' homepage links target a new window
